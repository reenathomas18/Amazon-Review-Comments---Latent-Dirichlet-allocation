1,Good but need updates and improvements
0,"Worst mobile i have bought ever, Battery is draining like hell, backup is only 6 to 7 hours with internet uses, even if I put mobile idle its getting discharged.This is biggest lie from Amazon & Lenove which is not at all expected, they are making full by saying that battery is 4000MAH & booster charger is fake, it takes at least 4 to 5 hours to be fully charged.Don't know how Lenovo will survive by making full of us.Please don;t go for this else you will regret like me."

0,Worst for gaming and music.. I bought this for the deca core processor it has but it works worse than a quad core processed phone. And it said it has 2 speakers but one of them (left) doesn't have a speaker just holes to cheat buyers. Decent camera and display. Battery could be made better.

1,"I am using Lenovo K8 Note (4GB, 64GB) Model XT1902-3 Type M2CB2 since last ten days. I am not fully satisfied with this product because I found one problem. Amazon described in the product description that this handset has both SIM slots with 4G enabled. But it is found that slot 1 support 4G whereas slot 2 supports only 3G, not 4G."

Delay in camera operating response.4. Delay in contact searching. It's irritating when we search for a contact and getting more time to save a contact.5. Very worst mobile in this range.Friends pls don't buy it. Go for some better mobile..I swear u will regret after you use it."

1,Amazing product in reasonable price range.

0,Poor camera
0,Not a good product...
1,The product is awesome
1,Great phone
0,Hang hota Hai phone
0,Great phone with excellent connectivity. Quick charging and excellent talk time due to the large battery. The twin camera requires steadier hands than mine. OTA update to Android 8.0. But the Bluetooth connection on this phone is intermittent and unstable.Supplementary information: The claimed gorilla glass 3 screen is probably ordinary glass as it cracked as the phone slipped from my grasp while sitting on a sofa. Lenovo says the screen is not covered. Reducing rating to two stars.
1,"Fast delivery. Delivery is to be provided for all districts. Good phone. Feels a bit heavy. Notification sounds can't be adjusted, is a bit annoying. Photos takes a lot more memory but not as much clarity for that memory. Other features are good."
0,I want return it
0,Me Bodru using Lenovo K8 note from 29th August.This mobile's performance so good.But it's battery does note perform as another 4000mhz battery mobile.So plz check it and try to solve it.

Average phone at this price segment.Though the cameras are supposed to be high performance but not satisfied.Battery charged quickly and lasts for a full day only.Lookswise ok, Lenovo again a name you can trust upon.But don't buy with too much expectations, simply an average smart phone and off course good for rough use."
1,"Not expected about the k8 performance is that much,I'm really happy about the product in all specifications,and the thanks to Amazon for given me good and non damaged product in time."
1,"The best phone in terms of specifications, audio sound, battery, screen,camera, ram, rom alongwith corning gorilla glass. All the best things in a mobile without burning ur pocket."

1,Good phone after update
0,It's good
0,Not a good phone.. In only 2.5 month it started hanging with more than 25 GB available memory in the phone. Camera is not also good. Now Lenovo have to seriously think about the performance of their mid range phones.
0,Ye Amazon wale both b.c hai .. PHN kharida Lenovo k8 note Usme game ka hanging issue hai.. b.c replace k ly Bolte hai par behanchod Layla dete hai... Bhosdi ke pese Jane ke bad service bhi nai dete Inka technician bhosdi ka game khelke Kenya hai koi problem nai hai .. in behanchod me copy phone bhej diya much mat kaharidna.. Amazon se .. bhot bhosdi wale hai...
0,Volte Calls & SMS not coming in when the phone is in standby mode..
1,All things are good about this phone.Smoothly running and no problem till now
1,This phone is goodBut camera is not so good as 13mp...Over all it's good phone heating problem during charging
0,Worst depth effect honestly if you want to buy a phone with depth effect then go for Mi A1 but this is not for youIf you are a selfie holic then I recommend you to buy this phone bcz the selfie here is literally good as compare to other phones in this price range this phone is on top in terms of selfieIn terms of processor I'll say that Snapdragon 625 is much better then this bcz this phone will not save your battery as Redmi phones does and this processor is built on 20 nm technology and Snapdragon 625 is on 14 nm that's 625 is battery efficient but Lenovo is providing you fast charger which is about 15w so don't worry you can get your day battery in just 1 hr. If you plug your phone on 20% then it will get charge 70 to 80% in just 1 hr. Which can last upto 8 hrs.on minimal usage so if you really want to buy this one i'll recommend you to buy this but keep in mind some cons of this phone when you're buying it.

They are asking me to go to lenovo customer care and get it verified even if it is faulty even being in returnable period. This is really disappointing. I strongly recommend people not to buy this garbage from this site."

I have an android TV box - not chrome castThere is a option in phone to cast under display,but disappointingly the phone could not find the TV.To me this a major draw back. It may not be a serious issue for those who do not use mirroring.Worst thing was when I wanted a solution from Lenovo team through live chat, the person who was chatting, one Mr Saleem says K8 can cast only through chrome cast.further when I was typing my next question, he abruptly disconnected.There are also lot many posts by several users complaining about the casting issue on K8 note."

After this there technical expertise person said need of change of mother board .I have questions about Lenovo product that mobile not having any physical and water dimage then how could possible mother board probleam and in Goa there is no any Lenovo care centre in Margao and Panjim it's near about 50 km from Margao. So Weast of my valuable time which is more cost than my money and also weast of my money . please do not go for this product. Bad service faulty products.
1,This phone is very good...I like this phone
0,"Got the phone delivered on time . That is the only good thing in this entire experience of mine . (Updated now) a new update , the first update didn't provide any noticeable difference but this one's log looks promising, let's see..I have been using various models of mobiles , have never seen such a terrible device , . Bought this after much thoughts by trusting the name Lenevo .I have been using redmi note 4 & it never had any issues with battery or even camera . Listening to music through YouTube , Browsing, Facebook , Insta , still solid backup for more than a dayI have 4 other phones also , MOTO G3 & Samsung S3 , HTC 628G , Samsung J7 Prime .This phone(Lenevo K8) seems to be worst among all.1)Battery : Has left me shattered with its worst battery life , Have just used to take some pictures , YouTube & songs , it goes down very Fast . (Yet to enter two sim card & use WhatsApp , Gmail , so if it continues to become more worst I'd surely update & escalate this )2),Camera Quality(For a dual camera , it is nowhere near Honor 6x which is 1k lesser) .if you are tricked by the dual camera ( it still has not got update of slowmo , Time lapse ) but it is really good when taken in Professional Mode with manual iso & focussing.A disaster in auto mode , that too for a rear camera with dual lens .I wish the company wakes up and starts rolling out OTA update for Camera & Battery life improvement.Other than that , The phone is super smooth , Display , Touch , Finger print sensor & stock Android is a bit of self satisfaction that I can say to myself for wasting 14K .I thought of gifting it to my father , but this would make it surely an incomplete gift .!Wish the company looks into these issues & provides updates for the Camera & Battery life because that is what it was paid for & marketed by the company claiming those 2 are the highlight factors.Lost interest to Even post pictures of it.With much regret."
1,"It was launched as the next big thing in budget smartphones and claimed to have the best camera in that range.Phone is OK.Decent battery life, not the best but still a decent camera.After 4-5 months of use I found it starts to hang a bit but I guess that‚Äôs normal with low budget android devices."

0,"After using few weeks I can say this phone has met all my expectations and I am completely satisfied with it, specially with camera and it‚Äôs effects, battery is up to the mark, Dolby speakers works really good ,no issues with memory, supports 4G on both SIM cards, wifi connectivity is also good...However there is some issue related to cell phone networks, specially during roaming areas, I could say there is small lack in the network chipset due to which sometimes it puts you in a situation where it‚Äôs doesnt shows you any kind of signal whereas other phones could get the network very easily.Overall performance is really good and satisfactory.Apart from this I haven‚Äôt received my jet previledge bonus points which I supposed to get for this order.Thanks"

0,Budget phone. Average battery. Fast charger saved the show. Front camera is good. Rear camera in normal mode is good but struggles in depth enabled mode. Dual SIM plus dedicated memory slot is added advantage. A bit of Android glitches were observed but nothing to worry. Looks are good. Venom black colour is quite impressive.

0,Worst phone I have ever seen battery not comes even half a day I have called several times to amazon to return the phone but their response also worst than this phone
0,"After around 3 months I finally came to a conclusion that this phone is average in all fields. Battery last for around 1 day of moderate usage after an overnight charge. Heating issues facing since the day I bought it. Gaming performance is good.I have tried all types of games including GTA San Andreas and Nova 3. There are no lags in the performance, the mediatek processor produce enough juice to pump the phone. I liked the selfie camera more than the primary one as the bokeh effect is crap and the single camera is also not good enough and here comes the major problem I'm having whenever any song is played on bluetooth connected speaker and the data is on the musoc starts distorting. Overall an average phone. I think there's more out there in this price range but it's not a complete failure. Regretting after buying."
0,Camera performance are not good

0,"To begin with, considering the price range I never had lot of expectations from this phone. Now that I have received it and used it for over 24 hours.. I would rate my experience as good!The touch of the phone is very good, soft and feels premium.Battery life is good however it does not show battery percentage on the main screen.Camera comes under average performance. The depth mode doesn't really serves the purpose here. Honor 6x has better camera than K8Performance of the phone is good.So overall, this is a good phone and when it comes to camera it's closest rival- Honor 6x takes the lead."

0,"Lenovo hyped this phone for it's Dual Rear Camera and a Deca Core MediaTek Processor and believe me these are the most worst things in this phone.Camera - The Dual Rear Camera is of No Use, It gives a fake bokeh effect. In depth enabled mode the camera struggles to focus. You will find the edges of the object are blurred along with the background. Without depth enabled mode both front and back cameras are just average.Processor & Battery - The Mediatek helio x23 processor is good in performance but since it is clocked at 2.3 ghz, the gets heated even on normal uses or while while charging. It aslo consumes the battery very fast, The 4000 mAH battery will hardly last for 1 day on normal uses.Sound Clarity - Nice Sound Clarity on speaker as well as earphone. Thanks to Dolby atmos.Display - Screen clarity is good.UI - Its a user choice, I am not a stock android fan as it lacks many features comes with custom roms like MIUI. Otherwise there is no problems with UI, it runs pretty smooth.Final verdict - Its just a average phone, there are many other good options available in market at same price point. If you are camera lover and want a good camera phone then go for Honor 6X, If You want good performance then go for Redmi Note 4 and If you want good performance with Stock Android then buy a Moto G5+"

1,perfect selfie phone
0,It gets very hot while using. I was using Lenovo K4 for last one year and was more satisfied with that rather this one @ 13999. Main drawback of this phone arebeautiful_ Cast (screen mirror) doesn't work. Bluetooth is also disturbing. Touch screen is not as sensitive as it should be with 4gb ram and 64 GB internal memory with 10 core processer. Display got broken very early with in two months of use. It's very normal and not as strong as k4. Hand grip is not good. Voice clarity not good and Dolby sound is just normal and speakers are very normal and sound is low. K4 was much better in this regard. Call logs and call recording another big drawback of this phone. I will not recommend this phone for purchase even @ the cost of 10k.
0,Not too good
1,All good but fingerprint sensor not working sometime..

0,"I got a repacked product. I took it to service centre to check the warranty. The warranty is valid till Dec2018 where as I bought the product only on 27April2018.

Really sucks* Mobile slightly heated up while gaming and long usage of data* Rear camera (5MP) is the worst.* Battery back about 8 hours* No 4K display so sometimes video quality poor.

0,"configruation is gr8, but UI is very poor at least somethings could have been added to make it user friendly, ultimate power saver and many other basic options are missing. It heats up while charging and customization options are totally zero, i hope maybe if they give Oreo update they add some features, Hardware is ultimate but what its worth without a proper software utilizing it. Please add some features, or make it open for us to use cyanogenmod and there will not be any warrenty void issue."

1,In 12000 it is a great phone some heat up issues and ram management is poor it's gpu performance is slightly lower than adreno gpu in 64 gb storage I get almost 51 gb camera performance and ram management may be improve in software updates battery lasts about 1 day for heavy users.some bugs in ui .in 24 Nov i simply using it and for 30 to 40 minutes it completely stop and after 1 hour it recovered.so these are my opinion regarding this phone.I bought it on sell for 12000 (4 gb ram 64 gb internal storage).so it is a decent phone for my point of view.Thank you

1,Worth to use online usage
0,"As soon as I bought the mobile from the courier person, I eagerly transferred songs from my older mobile and started the Google music player in Lenovo k8 Note to experience it's fantastic Dolby Atmos Surround Sound which I had experienced in Lenovo k4 Note. But I was very much disappointed that Lenovo k8 Note doesn't provide Dolby Atmos Surround sound AT ALL.Dear manufacturers, Kindly take your previous edition Lenovo k4 Note and check it's sound and compare it with k8. It is worst as your competitor's Dolby Atmos. Don't replicate those duplicate Dolby Atmos. Come back again with dual Front facing Speakers as Lenovo k4 which has excellent Dolby Atmos experience. And even, using top branded Headphone, did not give much difference between 'With Dolby Atmos' and 'Without Dolby Atmos' option.The main reason why I bought :Lenovo k8 Note is the Lenovo's Real Dolby Atmos sound (as i thought before buying), otherwise your competiror has all other specifications as K8. But even Lenovo started making false promise (like your competitor) that the mobile has 'Dolby Atmos' by just enabling some Equilizer options like just we had in 2000's mobiles, but the output is 'Null'."

0,Battery back problem
0,"Nothing extraordinary to call it a killer note. Camera which lenovo has boasted of, is poor like all previous lenovo phones, The dual camera setup is just a gimmick and takes ordinary quality photos. Dolby atmos sound output is of average quality, it was better on earlier lenovo's. The headset volume while on call is very low compared to previous lenovo's, redmi & mi, samsung's. Making K8 note pure android experience, lenovo has robbed users of some good features available on the previous lenovo's. Hence the software is a big let down, lenovo should have stripped down the vibe UI to near stock experience instead of dumping it. Also, a phone cant be called a killer if it doesnt have the basic function of backlit keys at the bottom. Software experience is not smooth as it should be considering the ram and motherboard and coupled with stock android.In my opinion, K8 note is nothing of what it was projected to be and the previous lenovo's were slightly better minus the full hd displays on them."

0,"Hi all, I have bought new lenovo k8 note. Frankly speaking lenovo making fool to customer through this product. Just for marketing they have given higher features in this price(like 4gb ram, 64gb ROM, dual camera) but all are of no use. If you buy some other company with lesser feature compared to this you will get much better experience. The most stupid thing lenovo done is very basic features they have removed like led notification is there but it never works except during charging, no call recording, no shortcuts for screen shot. I got alert saying low. Battery and 15% was there then automatically switched off immediately.These feedback by just exploring little, let me explore more than i ll share with more feedback"
1,"Features at this price are not regrettable but the price slashed by 1000 in just one month made me think about the brand as a wholeso. All said, it is a decent deal at this price if you are not concerned about the camera quality."

In second slot also I'm using Airtel but when I start switch on internet my network lost automatically. I seen YouTube Lenovo customer reviews vedio with same problem.

0,"- Primary camera not worthy- Cast screen not able to detect any smart TV's- Screen sharing option not available- No Parallel apps options- Unable Wifi connections though strong Wifi- Mobile data connection breaks for every minute- Screenshot option is pathetic- Many smart options which are available in budget phones are not available in this phone.- Heating and hanging is another problem- Could not able to find call recording options.Looks to me most of problems can be resolved with appropriate updates and software enhancements so I will amend rating once Lenovo address above issues, If Lenovo not keen to address basic issues then you will get better options even in budget phones also."
1,I thought I'll b getting earphones with the box but it's just a phone
1,Superbbb!!

0,Network and battery heating prob
0,Data cable of this product is not working
0,The product is not worth the money at all. The battery backup is very bad and phone keeps on restarting frequently. Would like to get another product or refund.
0,This Lenovo divice is overheated while charging and while mobile data turned on.
1,Lenovo not give the task manager and camera is best but one speaker is not work. And cellular network is very good.
1,I use this phone i feel good
0,Its deliver 1day prior to scheduled time which was nice. Specification says its a VoLTE supported phone but in reality its NOT. Need to install a jio4GVoice if want to use jio sim in it for making and receiving calls. Cant make or receive calls on Jio network if connected to wifi which is pathetic. Overall I am not happy due to all of these issues.
1,"Great phone, with the stock Android it's the smoothest phone that I have used till date. The built quality is also descent and the front and rear cameras perform good. This phone is for heavy users like me . And the 4000 mAh battery is good enough for a full day's work. If you are looking for a phone that is all rounder in this range, the k8 note is always a great option. One thing that i left out is the sound quality which is good being backed by dolby Atmos . This 4gb ram varient is very good. Although the 3gb ram varient has some issues . But this one is completely fine."
0,Very bad product from lenovo battery is overheating so much
0,"I bought this phone in first sale. I inserted one of my two mobile SIMs & then started updating/downloading the application and then thought to insert the second SIM. When I tried to do so, the SIM slot was not opening at all. I have raised the return request but unable to do so as no one is able to remove the SIM card, even mobile repairing shops.Charging is not fast.Dual camera is better than regular 13 MP.Mobile is just OK.Amazon team helped in refund process. Happy with Amazon but I may not buy this phone again."
0,"Lot's of issues, bo not buy this phone"
1,Super
0,Not so good.Expected better product.The phone is little bit slow & battery is not that good.Brought at high price.Later price dropped.
1,"Overall satisfied, value for money no doubt in that. But battery performance is not up to Mark. Earlier was using Panasonic eluga a2 with 4000 mAh battery which will last whole day and will be about 34% -25% balance charge. But this one draining battery faster. Overall it's good choice. Turbo charger also not giving any speed to change fast. Actually it's taking 1 hour to 1:30 hours to charge full"
1,lt's very awesome handset and features are excellent and specially it's easy to operate
0,"Camera not capturing pictures,and the battery is like 2000 mah the mobile sucks waste of money expected alot from the Lenovo but it failed"
0,"I am received the Lenovo k8 note ,i am using this mobile eighteen days. The main problem is battery draining is very fast. Battery is taking 4 hours to charge and getting drain in 6 hours. Incoming calls not receiving at times even though full signal. It's Consume very much memory. Heating issue comes after some hour use. Dual rear camera is not working. Always hanging this phone,,,It's quality is too bad.Not something good for buying.Also Amazon has a cheating policy now a days for return and refund. They are asking for some local app to check the phone. Which doesn't have battery checking option."
0,"The games start to lag a little bit after playing for a hour and gets heated up (not expecting from new phone , don't know what happens when it gets old ) but phone have rigid body , phone ram fills up to 75% sometimes not so handy while gaming.......and finally stop decreasing it's cost it hurts us a lotüòÇüòÇ"
1,Phone is good...best in class..but battery is not much like 4000
1,With respect to price and features...this is a perfect smart phone that anyone can have it.
0,There is a heating issue in this device and finger print sensor does not work in 1st time........

Suddenly problem arises, didn't understand what happened suddenly, phone getting discharged fastly and when I charge the phone it will take more time almost 6hrs to complete full charge and moreover phone is getting too heat while charging. It's not happened for first two months., but it's totally disappointed.Is there any chances in getting exchange to the product"
0,Waste of money
1,If you are looking for simple and sweet phone then go with this handset.. If you are a basic user like using normal whatsapp instagram nad few other apps in daily usage then it is good.... Battery life is average. Camera is also average..... You can say it is giving the performance for the price which you are paying.
1,Nice phn
1,"Writing this review after eight months of using this phone, this phone is very good in it's build qualitySupereb! Front 13 megapixel camera with quit powerful front flash. Performance is very good I play a lot of games does not lag in gameing.Cons- when talking about the cons of this product is that, the Bokeh mode and the blur effect is not very good just average same goes to Battey backup just a bit less not as good as MI phones on heavy usage you have to charge it again in the evening."

1,Excellent phone better than redmi note 4. It does heat up occasionally not every time and that too not that much. Battery performance is I would say above average as it lasts almost 1 day with 4000 mah battery. Performance is great. No complaints with the phone. Loved it.

0,Very poor battery. Phone heats slot and take 2.5 hours to charge there is no turbo charging.
1,Ummaah to Bolby ATMOS. I love this device also due to stock Android OS. Bass is very detailed. Use 16 Ohms earphones (Sennheiser CX 300 II or CX 180 only as they'll give enough loudness. I love its sound output. Audio output is 3 times better than my iPhone. Motorola and Lenovo are my permanent brands from now. I regret for returning my Moto G6. People are fools who buy any other brand when it comes to Android OS. Google should consider Motorola phones as their flagship device.
0,After 5 days of usage I find some issues in my Lenovo K8 note. Whenever I install a new app I can't find the app in my app list. When this happens I should restart my phone then only I can see the app in my app list.Not only that whenever I use my share it and minimises it then I found some glitches on my lock screen and home screen also and this happen with Asphalt 8 too.Please tell me someone that why this happens to my Lenovo k8 note and what should I do this.is there anyone to know about this please tell me...

0,"product not soo good its ok. And in this product gives dual camera but use only one camera, main mobile over heat issue"
0,Heating issue..........
0,"It's Heats up in short time , for charging it's takes around 3 to 4 hour and worst part takes same time to drain without using it for whatsup , You tube,or gaming feels Hot in hand. Holding Phone more than 10 to 15 min feels scary too as if it will gets Burst . Long charging time huge issue."
0,I bought this phone on flash sell for Rs13999. Now it is in the price range below Rs.12000. The reason is obvious. Very poor battery back up. Camera is below average. Finger sensor is staggering to recognise. Sometimes hanged to execute simple applications which ran smoothly in my earlier smart phone whose configurations are far below than this. I assure what they promised actually is a total failure. Don't waste your valuable money into it. I doubt whether the company can rectify or upgrade the performance by software upgradation. The only positive think (?) Is it's look and screen size. Feeling sorry how Amazon can promote this product with such vigorous advertisement.
0,Mobile is too bad and lot of network issue
1,Good product with good packaging.
0,"Fake dual camera... Depth mode is of no use. Its just edits the pic and the produced pic feeld like badly edited... Battery sucks... Heating problem... No Volte... Jio sim won't work unless you use jio app. Dual Camera is fake... Even when you place you finger in front of the 5MP camera, your phone will still take a blurred background pic which clearly says that the pics are edited and the 2nd 5MP camera is of no use."
0,On offer this product is great.but redmi note 5 is a good competitor of k8 note.

0,"Plz do not purchase, as Lenovo's stock android is having lot of issues and still lenovo has not taken any action to correct them. Hardware wise it is nice but lacks updates"
0,Phone getting overheating since the day 1
1,"The mobile absolutely good for some of its unique features at this price.It had a dedicated SD card slot,front flash,extra music button and so on.... Iam using this for a month and I'm fully satisfied. One point i like to add here is,other than fingerprint the face recognition works soo good and unlocks in less than 0.5 seconds . This phone had a very great user experience. Thanks to lenovo.But one disadvantage is that it doesn't support screen cast to smart televisions and other devices."

1,Good phone
0,"I ordered this phone and it showed that they would deliver me the latest version of android 8.0 Oreo. They delivered me a old version and as well as the device was faulty. I showed this phone to the lenovo service center, they said that this device is faulty and suggested that we should return this back to amazon. I then contacted the amazon customer care service but they refused to take the device back as the device return period was over which is completely accepted by me but these guys cheated on me as they delivered me a faulty piece and refused to take the phone back. The phone does not catch the signal of the WiFi even if the router is next to it. I also have two tablets of lenovo, they connect to WiFi instantly from anywhere in the house, this was happening because of the old 7.1.1 Noughat version so I went to the lenovo service center and upgraded it to a android 8.0 Oreo but then the condition became even worse and it also stopped getting signal. I am not satisfied with my device and I want this faulty device to be taken back by amazon and return me my Rs.11650. The Amazon has cheated on me as the return back policy does not allow me to make a replacement of this device. I want amazon to tale back my device as soon as possible."

The phone is good, camera good in lighted areas, speed is good, battery is good but what has annoyed me the most is the temperature. You charge the phone, surf, use social media, play games, do whatever, it heats up so much that you won't be able to hold it. I play games, i use two usb fans, connected to my laptop, pointed at the back of the phone, and a damp cloth to keep playing. It heats up with in 5 minutes of playing any game. When I charge, i keep the fan running. For just this one issue all the plus points of this phone goes down the drain. In would not buy another lenovo and would not recommend buying K8 note."

It's a tad big for my taste, but decent. It does not get a proper screen guard, as it's little curved from sides, screen guards don't stick from corners or sides. Ram although 4 gb on paper, actually it's only 3.7, n out of it too 3 pre occupied mostly.Decent enough 100% worth your money, only competition I can think of is redmi note 5"

The portrait mode is just ok. Nothing exceptional. The camera modes are good too. I feel the RAM management could have been better. Coming to the main part. The battery life is utter nuisance. It doesn't hold up like a 4000mAh battery. If u r willing to purchase it for its battery, please stay away. I charged the battery to 80 percent in the morning at around 8.30 n found the battery to be 52 percent at around 4 p.m. The thing to be noticed is that the device was used not a bit. It was idling the whole while. The performance of the phone is very good. It does get warm while charging and playing games but nothing unbearable."
0,"except camera, I think rest of the other stuff is same like other Lenovo phones, I don't feel this phone have any extra ordinary quality. Look and feel is total LOW QUALITY PHONEMONEY WASTE dual camera is not workingWorst phone by Lenovo...All the application suddenly stops working while using it...If it's the last phone on earth still don't buy. Lenovo claims deca core processor but performancene is lesser than the phone having four core processor."
0,Phone ok but some lag in gaming and camera not perform well may be software issue... overall gud package little costly
0,Good
1,Good phone and Excellent features for this price
0,"It's worst phone.amazon is the one reason to by this phone . Amazon ad shows(good killer performance,good camera quality, battery back,etc...).. It's not worth for this.Already i have HTC desire 816g . lenonvo is not worth for that..Lenonvo is worst company they give a fake ads"
0,Bad phone
0,Its got Heating Problem.. and finger print unlock is like only for phone and the 5 MP Back camera is a Drawback. Its not a WATER REPELLENT PHONE. Lenovo doesnt have any water proof phone.. so DONT BUY this phone .. i really had a bad experience with Phone and service center people..and if you go to Lenovo service center for warranty these people will talk about their policies first instead of providing a solution . They cant solve any of your phone issue and they move on.
0,not satisfied
0,Worst phone ever seen for that price range. Waste of money
1,Very good
0,DONT EVER BUY THIS MOBILE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE SCREEN MIRROR FEATURE .EVEN CHEAP MOBILES HAVE THIS FEATURE.
0,"This review is a exact outcome of using this mobile for more than a month.Pros and Cons:--------------------------1. Battery backup close to 2 days approximately including idle time, internet and call usage. So rest assured, you are in good hands. I have attached screenshot of my battery usage.Note: Keep your mobile charge for at least 8 hours before the first time use.2. Turbo charge great as expected. So yes, it gives your cell more time in hand.3. Camera HDR feature really capture detailed images. Front camera with flash is a nice feature.4. This phone works with 4G, 3G and 2G speeds.5. Dual separate Nano Sim slot and additionally it has separate memory card slot for external storage. You will never run out of storage issues.6. Fingerprint sensor response time is very faster and you can use the same for taking photos. Additionally you can use it as a App lock for unlocking important apps.But you have to install separate app from play store (Cons).7. Google personal assistant feature is awesome.8. Dedicated Music key in left. But you can also use this as a shortcut for few useful actions like taking screenshot and camera.9. Call management is really difficult, need to download apps from play store for setting call waiting and etc.. (Cons)10. Voice recorder need to be downloaded separately (Cons)11. Hardware is really awesome but software needs lots of customization. (Cons)12. Just Double Tap to awake the phone and you can see the time and date without unlocking it.13. Press the Volume key and click on the Bell symbol to put your phone on vibrate and silent.There should be some shortcut has to be provided for this (Cons)14. Design of this phone is an absolute killer.15. Cast screen option is only supported with chrome cast device. So you cannot share anything with smart TV without this casting device. (Cons)However you can play YouTube videos from phone to Smart TV with inbuilt YouTube application which comes with casting.Overall it's a good phone and worthy for money you pay, because it has lot customizations needed to be done and have to download apps for basic things. so My rating is 4 stars.."

1,Pros:----------:- 4Gb ram enough for multitasking.:- 10 core processor:- 64 Gb space:- Camera blurring effect.:- Good battery life of 4000mahCons:------------&:- Earphones not available.:- Must be gorilla Glass.
0,The product I received is defective. One of the two is not working. Left speaker is not working and right speaker is working. I want to replace the product but the steps for returning the product is not proper on Amazon. It says to down load the smart check app. I did that and run the app. But the app says my product is good. I called Amazon and explained the issue. He says to move to nearest authorised service center and get the letter that the product is defective. Don't know how the problem will be settled.

1,GoodBut Earphone missing....
0,"Lenovo always has great Specs on Paper and Poor Performance & stability in real-life.This is my 3rd & last Lenovo (over 6 years) - K3 Note didn't work well. VIBE had battery reboot issues and went to repair center twice. Now This.K8-Note Issues(1) Very poor battery. Particularly with GPS on, it dies far more rapidly than Samsung or any other phone(2) Poor drivers. When I plug in the ear phone and remove them, the normal speaker stops working. Can't hear voice on incoming calls. Needs reboot.(3) WiFi is flaky. Connection drops suddenly. Picks up again.(4) Hangs when multiple Apps are opened. Suddenly you find you cannot even take incoming calls.All this WITHIN 6-8 months of purchase of the phone.Adieu Lenovo. I tried hard to like you."
1,The killer note's KILLER indeed.
1,Using it since 2 weeks .. no such lags or problems faced yet.. initially there were bugs which was solved with the provided update. The dual camera setup is just a myth! Overall battery performance is awesome.

1,Good phone .Nice camera Nice look
0,Waste brand LENOVO NOT VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCTS
0,"Good mobile.solid build. Multitasking is so buttery. Ram management can be better, Lenovo need to work on this. Battery backup is better after the recent September security patch.Dual camera setup is just a gimmick, The dept mode is just waste of time and money. Single primary camera from both front and back take decent pics. Camera app definitely need improvement.The capacitive buttons are not backlit, but didn't faced any issues in dark.The most annoying thing about the mobile is, suddenly a popup raises and says Amazon app is not responding or some other 'X' app is not responding and sometimes I am not able to launch some heavy apps after installing from Google play store.Mobile heatsup only while charging, didn't faced issue while playing games like Asphalt air borne, war robots. But there were frame drops while playing war robots."
1,Powerful phone
1,Nice
1,reasonable price...better phone...fast delivery..thank you..amazone
1,Excellent product
0,Good phone..lot of improvements in camera..however battery back up is bad compare to earlier Lenovo phone like Vibe p1 turbo. K8 note lacks feature of restricting auto start of apps which was there in earlier phones. Hence battery drains fast in K8 note.Though turbo charging but it takes almost 2 hours to full charge.Also one of the most irritating thing is notification volume is same as ring volume which disturbs your routine because if you keep ring volume high then notification sound is also highNo schedule power on-off featureWe expect some add-on features by Lenovo to overcome these issues
0,Every thing seems good except the battery life.
0,There is some issues in the phone. In status bar time is not updating properly.sound quality is bad I think it's software issue. It vary time to time.headphone sound is not buzzing
0,"Lenovo K6 power is better in many ways than the k8 note like low budget (9999&10999), good speaker sound ( more loud & clear sound than k8 note) with dual speaker back side (k8 note has only 1 speaker at bottom), more battery backup with same 4000mah battery( k6 power's battery consumption is very less than k8 note, you can use k6 powwr for more hours than the k8 note with full charged battery), comfortable Size (5"" screen, easily fit in pocket), free in-box earphones (in k8 note earphones are not provided), more features than k8 note.K6 power lounched 6months before lounching of k8 note. But still it(k8 note) doesn't have functionality which k6 power already has.Functions which is not in k8 note are as follows:1) Wide touch(to lock phone, shortcut for many recent app, its just like apple button)2) quick snap (double tap volume button to take screen shot)3) smart scene (to open any action by time or by on connecting any device like wifi etc, by this function you can set your brightness low for night time by set action time 8:00 pm - 7:00 am, or silent your phone between office hours automatically many other things)4) fingerprint snap: you can take photos by touching fingerprint sensor)5)dual app profile: (two WhatsApp/fb account simultaneously)6) quick flashlight: (by tapping home button twice)7) secure zone, guest mode: (in secure zone you can install same apps with different account and that apps can only work when you open secure zone with password)"
0,"The phone seems alright with just about 2 weeks of using it. I did come across an error with the phone.process stopped responding and I had to restart my new phone. Hangouts is another app that just crashed when I started using it on this phone. Lastly, the battery is not exactly living up to the expectations of being a 4000 mAh battery. Else the features, look, audio, camera are all good. It's quite smooth is handling it.There is no headset that comes along with this handset."
1,Awesome
1,"Good product in this prise range.I found camera quality is good as compare to other phones in the same prise range. Display is also good. Sometime phone gets heat after using for long time, maybe because the processor."

1,Super
0,Camera is not good
0,"Not at all recommended. My Lenovo K8 has the following issues:1. Poor signal strength - Tried different SIMs like Vodafone, JIO, etc, But signal shows only 2-3 bars. Whereas the same SIMs when inserted in other 4G handsets, it shows full strength n no call drops.2. Heating Problem: The company has added 4000 mAh battery because they knew that this handset will get heated and drained battery quickly. On using simple day-to-day work, it gets heated like anything. And the full battery drains within half day."

0,"I am utterly disappointed with the brand itself. The K series was hyped up due to its packed specifications. But this particular mobile went down the drain in less than 6 months.Things I want to specify about this mobile:1. The mobile is quite heavy, not pocket-friendly2. Picture quality is average for dual rear camera and the front camera isn‚Äôt good either.3. The mobile heats up real fast while watching a video or in a call.4. At some point, The turbo charging stopped working, it took forever to charge it back.5. I don‚Äôt like the resolution of the phone either.I‚Äôve given away my mobile to the customer service, Hope it survives. Better not go for this mobile."

While talking on phone, if you have to see some thing like any message, then it takes 5-6 seconds for screen lights to come up once you move it away from your ear. Never buy this worst phone. Operating system is pathetic."

0,"YesI had great expectations while buying this post review. But turned out to be a thumbs downWhile Lenova K8 note comes with amazing configuration, it could not stand out to my previously used MI note 3 which I bought for 9k 2 years back.

1,Nice mobile below 10k range.Battery life is really long lasting. Not lagging though I have fulled my memory n install more than 150 apps.Cons. Screen mirroring is only with google chrome.

Bhokeh effect is not working okay . If u want to buy it for photography don't go for it . U can get better option cool 1 dual as better option for photography. I am using both phones
1,Phone is average. Not as Lenovo promised. There is no turbo charging. Sometimes it lags too and camera quality is also normal. Touch and screen is impressive. In my views it is just an average phone not something to hype about.

0,"So apparently, if your charger cable degrades, you have to shell out Rs 1500 to replace your Mobile Charging port too. Why you ask? Because they can not connect phone to PC using ""broken"" cable (Not any other working cable, because that is against their Policy), so they diagnosed that charging port too must be faulty. I am amused how many ways people come up with to cheat customers."

0,"Lenovo K8 note quality issue! Very disappointed! I purchased Lenovo K8 note on 18th August 2017. I was very disappointed to find that whenever I stream videos online or download videos from internet, the videos lacks sharpness and accurate colour reproduction even at higher resolutions! The videos are unwatchable! But the same videos look perfect when they are transferred to internal memory of the phone or SD card via a computer or any other storage drive. Even the videos shot on Lenovo K8 look perfect. The quality issue occurs only when you stream or download videos from the internet! Such poor quality control from Lenovo is just not acceptable! Also, the LED notification light doesn't work with Whatsapp, Messenger, Facebook etc. It only activates when you have an unread SMS, email and missed calls. It does not work with any other app!! There is no such thing as fast charging in this phone even though it is mentioned on the box! The 4000 mah battery takes more than 2 hrs to charge and if you are using the phone while charging then it may take indefinite time to charge completely. Moreover the battery drains so quickly that you may think you are using a 2500 mah battery phone. Just lasts for 3/4th day even with casual to moderate use! Be-aware guys if you are going for this phone be ready to compromise on video viewing quality, basic functions of LED notification light, battery life and battery charging time!"

1,Awesome product.
0,Not sure about other features ... but the battery backup is poor. Atleast Lenovo could not maintain the same level of quality in this product. I purchased the one .. and after a week found ~30% battery drain overnight when the phone was completely idle. It stared draining 8 to 10% in 10 mint of usage. Called customer care ... they connected the device via SmartTest app and noted the problem. Thanks to Amazon ... within couple of days they replaced and delivered a new one. The same story repeated again ... this time they arranged a technician visit ... as per his report Amazon scheduled the pick up and arranged the refund. Thanks Amazon for wonderful customer service. Now Im really scared to buy such things from stores. Im sure they will not take it back and will advise me to go to service center.

0,"i am not a big fan of lenovo, but i was compelled to buy this product due to its specs at a reasonably low rate and i was correct lenovo has done nly one thing rite to quire motorola and that can only save them. I am using lenovo k8 note for past 1 month andi have started getting issues like heating , at times too slow for the basic use itself. These cons can be accepted but for the past few days i am getting issues with charging, it cahrges for few minutes then automatically it stops. Really a bad experience with phone with usage of 1 month only"
0,"[Initial Review: 22-Aug-2017]I've been using this phone for last 3 days, so this is kind of initial review. Buying experience and delivery was crisp thanks to Amazon Prime, amazing.1. The design is not a eye catcher, but nothing wrong about it either2. The camera is OK and nothing impressive. Low light photography is grainy3. Heating is a serious problem. It gets hot after long usage. Not unbearable, but not desirable either4. OS is nice and close to stock. Addition of some Moto s/w makes it even better5. No lag or performance issue so far4. Display is good but on the dimmer side. Would loved to see a brighter display6. Battery back up and fast charge work fine7. Sound through good earphone is above the price rangeVerdict: Before jumping into conclusion you might want to consider LG Q6 and to be launched Nokia 6 or better Redmi Note4                                                                                       [UPDATE#1 : 25-Aug-2017]It's been a week since I'm using this. Below is the update in addition to my initial review.1. The phone battery drains fast compared to the capacity and it hardly lasts a day2. The bokeh effect is not something worthy, lot of manual stabilization and patience is required to get a good shot3. heating problem continues and it seems a permanent issue4. Poor OS optimization and thus not suitable for heavy gaming, plus the heating issue5. Works fine with Jio VoLTE, both for calls and dataVerdict: Hype is not delivered."

Go for it guys.

0,"Dear Amazon / Lenovo,I purchased this phone as a gift for my father who is 70+ yrs hoping that the large screen and its ease of operation would help him. Right from the start after receipt of the phone my father kept complaining that there is a problem with the phone as screen does not respond / wake up (if locked) or notify an incoming call; so he is only able to hear phone ring but not able to receive the call. I thought it was a settings issue but when we took to Lenovo service center at Prime Mall, Irla, Vile Parle (w), Mumbai on 18 Oct 2017 the service Center representative said that we should have returned the product in 15-days and then took in phone for software reload. My father spent Rs 700 for backing up & reloading data. After this software reload the product worked ok until 27 Oct 2017 and then the same incoming call issue has reoccurred.Now my father who is 70+ yrs old is sick of this phone and this problem and doesn‚Äôt want it.Kindly assist in the matter please."
1,I received phone quickly & short time... Good work..
0,Camera awesome. Touch perfomance good.sound quality is best. But where is defaut Gallery? Where is clipboard? Where is defaut music player? Too Weight(190gram).
0,"This product doesn't meet all the expectations it created at the time of launching.1. Processor and Camera is good. No buffering while watching videos in you tube / live tv / dedicated portals of TV network.2. Trendy look, easy handling and lenovo could have provided headsets in the accessory kit. That was missing!!!!3. Turbo Charging was good initially after couple of months it started deteriorating from its set standards. It takes time min of 1.30 hrs for 20% when the battery capacity is at 80%.4. Battery life is not as expected for 4000 mAH. For a non gamer with limited default apps it should last for more than a day when used fully under mobile data. But battery drains out quickly.5. Ear piece volume: there is a problem in all lenevo mobiles that, while on call near by person can hear the voice of other person. Its very pathetic when it comes to whatsapp calling. It gives us a feel, like we put our mobiles on speakers. The volume is too loud even though the same is kept at least level. Lenovo technical team should pay more attention on this set back.6. Audio Output : Could feel dolby atmos effect only when we keep our palm near speakers. Else this feel is missing completely. Its because of single outgo at the bottom of the device due to which this feature got misfired i believe. Tested this feature specifically with dolby atmos effect videos which is widely available in web pages.7. Otherwise, got this mobile on deal. So when compared with other models i got the device for what i have paid for. i should compromise myself in that way.8. Could feel heating issues when mobile data is used continuously for more than 25 minutes or during on a call for more than 15 minutes.Hope this review helps."

1,Phone is good but don't by now as there r more options.Battery drains like Micromax which is not expected in Lenovo perhaps the high end display has resulted this.if ur darling is ur smartphone then I m sorry to say she can run for only 6 hours continuously.so think wisly n heartly before taking this.There is no problem of overheating.Dual app settings is not available a big disappointment if u use that. There r no head phones with u have to buy that urself

0,"Got this phone delivered today and I was not completely impressed by it.The pros:Absolute fine display.Good camera quality.Great finishing to the body work.Comes with transparent body cover.Dual SIM and Micro SD can be used altogether.Charge speed/Power backup is best in class.The cons:No earphones.Has Dolby Atmos but no Audiophile sound. (Not as loud and clear as K4 Note and Vibe X3 with earphones). Not suited for music enthusiasts at all.Stock Android 7.1 version is rugged and not so user friendly. Too many settings are replaced and are annoying to navigate through.Overall, a decent phone at great price considering the hardware package being offered."

0,My Experience was very bad when I used Lenovo K8 Note. I think it was one of the worst product I ever use. There are so many issues with this product. The battery backup is mazor issue. On the box it has 4000 MAH Battery . But it was drained maximum 5 - 6 Hours in normal condition. Its annoying . The phone has two big issues also - 1. Heating Issue 2. Hang issues. Only the phone camera is good. It is the worst smartphone I ever use. I dont want use this product kindly return it and give my money back.

0,"I will not recommend this phone . Its battery back up is poor and video quality doesn't match with the same end phones.I want to suggest buyers who are planning to buy this phone don't buy this ,, instead of K8 Note go for K8 plus ..K8 plus and k8 note has small difference in specs but very big differences in performance. K8 plus has good battery life and last for almost 1 day after heavy use (in my case)., k8 note has same 4k mah battery but drains very quickly.Gaming experience quite nice on k8 plus and k8 note both..No lags. K8 NOTE has some heating issue while charging but k8 plus has very minor or no heating problems.I have both the phones and among both of them k8 plus seems good to me.Thank u."

1,Best mobile in this price
0,Am not get 15%off discount...
0,The phone hangs and restarts...apparently it is something to do with the software update... Quite ridiculous because one would expect the phone to perform better with an update when the memory is half unused and that there are not many applications
1,"Awesome mobile at this price, good battery backup, super camera clarity & flash on both front & back, huge memory (64GB inbuilt & 4GB ram) & also dedicated memory card slot, dual SIM, every thing is good. But tempered glass is not fit for the curved finish display, so can be rated 4."
1,"Everything thing is perfect but it is having 2 major problems,1. Secondary camera and Boke effect is zero performance, it's nothing there just a marketing strategy.2.Bluetooth is not working properly, getting struck while playing audio through Bluetooth and even when we switch the Bluetooth on it won't connect fast it will tries to connect all other devices which are not in range(have connected in past) if we click on particular Bluetooth device also it won't responds correctly.Plz try to rectify it..Otherwise it's a very good product for this price.!"
0,"Nothing to go awww with the specs, neither the phone is dud.Music & Camera- Nothing exciting, Music is strictly Ok, Camera is decent.Software- Few glitches in the software, we cant see the battery percentage, no provision for night eye care view. (K6 Note had)Gaming- Avoid if you are a gamer and like to play for 2-3 hrs daily. Phone gets heat up above 40 degrees. Also, I saw lags in phone while playing basic games.Speed- If multiple applications are runned, than there is chance that phone will get slightly slow.Display- Superb, at this price tag.Overall review- Nice phone, but could have been way better had Lenovo used SD625 chipset, they should not had compromised on chipset.Still, not a bad purchase,, just get your priority right.Update- Please don't buy this device that is my humble request to all"

0,Very poor battery!!! Does not even last for a full day on normal usage. The 4000mah battery on the Redmi 4 lasts for two days almost with normal usage. This phone is definitely not comparable to the Redmi 4. This is no 'killer' note. The supposed to be fast/turbo charger is a normal charger. Takes over 3 hours to charge the battery from 15 to 100%. Disappointed totally

0,"DON'T BUY K8. SOFTWARE BUGS.This is my 1st negative feedback. There are issues with notifications. Contacted Tech Support team to whom even making the problem understood is a Herculean task.. so you can forget about resolution. Only answer available is ""escalating, team work, shall revert at earliest"". Hope we all know what such responses mean. I AM DISGUSTED WITH LENOVO. They claimed K8 to be killer..Yes it would kill your want to use smartphone !!!Don't waste your time and money on a half cooked phone released in hurry to counter Nokia.I repent buying it and thought it prudent to warn the fraternity of potential buyers.Rajiv Pathakrajivpathak27@gmail.com"
1,Nice and Excellent working on it.
1,It's an amazing product at this price. The only thing I found lacking is the internet connectivity and the battery back up. Though it claims to have 4000 mAh back up but with frequest browsing and talking it gets exhausted very fast. There is no lagging the phone responds to your type request very fast and the Google assistant is saviour. Over all a good phone to go ahead with.

0,I bought this product from a flash sale on Amazon in August 2018. It's been just 7 months and this 13999 mobile with 4gb ram behaving like some cheap product it switch off automatically 8-10 times a day. Twice I have been to the service center but the problem persist. They say it's ok now and I face the same problem the very same day. Now I m trying to get it exchange with any other phone and I m getting 2700 offer from Amazon. Wow
0,Not good product. Only battery is good. Bluetooth is very bad
0,"This phone doesnt feel like a 4000mah phone. Even my lenovo vibe k5 note gave better backup than k8 note.The ram doesnt feel like a 4gb ram either. Even when you dont have any apps running, the ram usage is high.Price wise this is decent. But there the specs on paper and the performance dont match up with each other.Unless lenovo optimise the performance and send in an update, my recommendation would be ""Dont Buy"""

0,I can't expect Lenovo to produce a product like garbage. Lenovo K8 note is just worst phone so far. K4 note was much better in design and performance which I used last before K8. Network issue is one and Hotspot issue is second big problem. I am unable to find network even sometimes at open places. And Hotspot do not work when you want to connect it with Laptop.So be careful is you are considering this handset.Also rear camera is garbage.Hell.

0,"The delivery was good which as usual from Amazon. But, the phone screen glass is very fragile. It is not the break resistant. I had my phone a small fall from about 2 ft and the glass broke. To replace, i have to shell out about 5k. I haven't expected this from the so called Gorilla Glass. It is not Gorilla glass 3 gen and hence be careful. It is not meant for even little rough use."
0,After two days of receiving the device started acting up. Touchscreen went wrong apps started opening automatically. If you press one digit several other digits automatically pops out.. Don't buy this phone i am asking for replacement but i don't knw the replaced device will be OK or not.. Don't buy Lenovo phones.. *review continue* #2.09.17.. i got the replaced product and its more horrible battery is not at all getting charged.. its taking 8 hours to charge 70%.. and after browsing for 10 mins battery will drain very fast and the phone becomes a fireball..so finally i have asked for refund.. and thanks to amazon that they too agreed for the same...
1,"Recieved just now,,,, I'm fully satisfied with this mobile, thanks to Amazon for your great delivery..."

0,"Bluetooth audio has intermittent noise.. Battery of 4000mah only is good for numbers, not in terms of long lasting device operation.Poor power management to blame. My earlier MI Max 2 with 5300mah gives 3 days battery. This one if it was equally good in power management should give at least 2 days, but barely lasts a day . Don't buy this"

1,Awesome performer Smartphone till date
0,"I bought it in August. And within 2 months, I had to rush to the service center to get the battery checked. Thank God, it was still in warranty period. After an update, battery started to drain profusely. Suddenly, it was taking 4-10 HOURS to get fully charged. It wasn't so before. The service center people say they'll call you once they fix your phone, trust me, they don't. The phone was okay for a while. The charger had a problem.Then again, while charging the phone, I was using it. Maybe for once. And Bam! The charger got damaged. I had used HTC before and used it while charging. Nothing ever happened. -_-Again I rushed. They charged some amount to get the charger cord fixed. Now it's working fine.Problems:1. It heats a lot. Can't use it without cover. Your hands will feel really warm if you don't.2. Can't send messages from Jio. Imagine!3. It's Volte. But on the status bar, it says LTE. Stupid.4. Very heavy. Heavier when you use tempered glass to protect the screen. And you won't get right kind of glass for the curved edges. Hence, though the screen looks really premium, you have to use a flat tempered glass with no curved edges. It ruins the actual look.5. Be prepared to be amazed if you didn't know stock Android phones don't have gallery (other than Google photos), no option for including ringtones, no theme, hardly any variety in the wallpapers and no customization."

It takes long time while connect with data network.Night camera is also not good.Only good thing in this phone having very good processor and very smooth touch screen and good speaker.

0,Three star because this phone has a major problem which is its Bluetooth. When connected to any Bluetooth device be it headset or speaker the sound is very distorting and then disconnects. This has been raised by almost everybody in Lenovo forum but no solution as of now. If you would be playing music on Bluetooth or phone on Bluetooth don't buy this phone.

0,Poor battery backup.
0,"Here is my experience of using lenevo k8 since 2 days. Got the mobile on first sale. With lot of expectations went for the phone.1)one of the worst phone i have ever used, very poor network signal. I was getting full signal on Airtel but on K8 I am hardly getting 2 bars. SIGNAL IS VERY VERY WEAK WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES.2)In the name of MEDIATEK HELIO X23 processor they have used old MEDIATEK HELIO X20 processor!!!3)Heating issue, the phone heats even after 5 mins of playing a game or using camera. It's back panel always feels warm and after few minutes of usage I cant even make call because it gets too hot for my ear to bear. we can't perform the most basic function of calling ( without feeling the heat), browsing etc. The device always feels warm in your hand and a simple 10 mins of browsing and then you cant hold it against your ear to make a call,yes, it gets this hot.4)Battery drains very fast, even when the phone is idle.5)The web support of Lenovo is also of no use. I made the mistake of buying this phone, all of you out there please dont make my mistake6)Notification led issues. I installed speed test and the Network speed is terriblly slow!!!.7)incorrect specification ""Dual nano SIM with dual-standby (4G+4G)"". In reality this phone support 4G+3G only like other phones.8)Signal strength is a huge pain. Sometimes calls drop unexpectedly. Amazon is not exchanging the product... poor network strength.I am going to make all my friends aware of the new amazon's return policy. Less in features not worth of money and expectations9)call recorder not working"

0,Trying to call also phone is getting hanged. Just 1 month old mobile. Don't go with lenovo k8 note.
0,Worst product!! Amazon doesn't even refund easily even though mobile is not working properly. Worst experience ever with manufacturer as well as seller.
0,"The features are excellent but the usability isn't there. Despite a 10-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, it hangs out quite frequently. I have an old Huawei Honor 6, 3 GB RAM - 2015 model, which is better than the new device. Also applications keeps on crashing quite frequently.Camera is of not good use too. The pixel clarity is inefficient as it gets blur upon zooming (after clicking of photographs). Also the time taken for saving the picture is +3 seconds after the click, which is quite high as I have never used such a slow camera in any phone.Battery life is good. With constant data, frequent calling and mail checks, it runs for 8-10 hrs. Also turbo charger is a great advantage.Speakers are another strong point in the phone. The sounds are great, means comparable or better than my Vaio Laptop.The phone boosts of Gorilla Glass, but got scratch within a week of use while keeping it in pocket only.Lenovo doesn't have any Gallery or Music Player apps, so had to download it from google play, which again either comes with advertisements or I need to purchase those. Hence, I am stuck with the advertised versions of basic apps. Also, had purchased New System Updates, still had to update 2 GB of updates in total 3 times. Still Oreo update would be available only in June/July.The worst part is I had gifted it to my wife, and now what I got in return is the complaints part, that too all the time. Means despite spending 10k approx., this device does not fulfil its advertised words."

1,Very cool phone. Easy to handle with almost complete features and specification.
1,Awesome
0,"I don't find this phone worth.the phone does not work as lenovo claimed. They used dual in depth camera, turbo charger as a gimmick. should go for honor 6x for best alternative for this phone.RAM Management: processor and ram management is very good. the phone does not lag.Camera: an Awful camera. don't know why its camera app decreases the quality of the image.The camera will really let you down.Charging: It takes around 2 hours and 30 mins to charge completely from 15% which is a lot if the company claims for turbo charger.Phone size & weight: There is some extra space at top and bottom which ruins phone handling experience.Sock Android: It is the only thing which is good.Network issue: after switching my sims to this phone having the issue of the phone going not reachable."

0,"Please refrain from getting cheated by buying this phone. In the form of a stock Android OS, this phone has regressed a great deal from the previous k series phones. It does not have many important features like long screenshot etc and screen casting/mirroring is only possible if you buy Chromecast device separately. The menus have changed from the previous version and are very user unfriendly. Lenovo has taken a big step in alienating loyal customers by releasing this substandard phone to our markets and I caution all potential buyers to beware or end up feeling cheated like I am."
1,"K8 note satisfied when compared to same range mobiles in market ,slightly dissatisfied with cam quality rest all okPros- good Battery capacity 4000mah,dual rear cameras,Cons- non removable battery and weights about 180 gms little heavier."

0,"This phone after getting the Oreo update, is completely useless. It gets heated like a pan. You can literally cook dosa on the phone. Lags like snail. Turbo charge takes 7 hours to charge. When contacted the lenovo customer care about the issue, they are even clueless of the issue and asking me to wait for official update from Lenovo, which they are also not sure when it will be released. If you buy the phone, dont damn update the phone with new software. Use it with the Stock OS, Android Nougat 7.x version."
0,Battery life is crap rest is OK
1,"Good product, could have been better."
1,Very good phone. In both of two camera front camera also Awesome but rear camera can take photo with blur. Sound quality also good with dolby atmos. Music key works good. Ovearl in this price range lenovo k8 note is a good performance phone. I love my phone

0,Camera is very very very poor don't trust this it's say 13mg pixel but pics are very poor in quality when u zoom into a pic the photo gets blurred it's not up to the mark . My opinion out of 10 I give 2 rank ..for camera ..over all performance is gud but camera is very bad not even expected of such a low quality camera
1,nice product

0,Third class mobile..do no buy
1,Nice
1,Price worth Mobile.
0,"Ordered this phone for my Wife after buying Lenovo K6 Power . Design is good, but Speaker sound surprisingly disappointing no where near to K6 power. Came to know that turbo charger is not actually a fast charger (Boom ! another surprise). Verified Camera and its nothing great compared to the way it is marketed. Overall, feeling little disappointed considering i was expecting it better than K6 power.Recommendation: Nothing Great, you can skip this one and wait for MI Pro 2 or more reviews of Moto G5 Plus."
1,Nice phone ..i was using this phone more than three weeks...There is no issue still i found..
1,It is better then my expectations...
0,"I have brought this product in oct 2017 , but from six month i am facing the heat issue in charging and calling . From 2 month managing to work with this,but its become worst condition now. Phone is in warrently, anyway to exchange this product"

0,Not good
1,"Nice piece, though very crudely packed. Timely delivered..."
0,"Faulty piece received. Facing Problem in touch screen. Keypad operating automatically. Apps, call history, dialling pads etc opening itself even not touching to the handset. Bad experience of purchasing through Amazon."
0,Worst phone ever. Never going to buy Lenovo products ever. Brought this phone 2 months ago and I was quite happy with the performance initially. But yesterday it was just fell off the bed and the display cracked. It cost me 5.2k for new display. So overall I had paid 20k for this phone which I don't think it worth.but I had no option. Suggest everyone to stay away from Lenovo products. Lenovo may offers you high configuration phones @ reasonable rates but believe me guys their maintenance is way expensive. God bless Lenovo consumers. Good luck.
1,Awesome ....üòòüòòüòò

0,Battery problem
1,I purchase this phone after many researches.camera is best at this price point.battery FHD display is good.almost everything is fine.but some cons. Are there also.usable memory is less than half of 32gb.phone takes a lot of time to start.except this the phone is best and really a killer note.
0,Turbo charging taking 6hours to get full charge while device is on and taking 3hours to get full charge while device is switched off then after battery is draining like anything. Im not a heavy user but this phone's battery draining in just 20hours.I feel im wasted my money on this device.Im not going to trust lenovo anymore n moreover ill spared my experience and discourage my folks towards lenovo products.
1,Nice phone k8

1,very nice mobile..
0,Battery back up not good....
0,Very poor handset please take it back
0,Phone overheats way too quick. 4000 mAh battery barely stays 2-3 of gaming. I used Redmi note 5 pro before this. Same 4000 mAh battery but Note 5 can handle 5-6 hours of gaming easily. Lastly turbo charging is joke; 10% - 100% in 2 hours 30 mins most of the time.

0,This phone is quite fast. It's finger sensor is useless when ever I try to use the finger sensor it says lens is dirty who will clean the sensor before every use or who will wash hands regularly before every use. One more point I could not find tempered glass screen protector for this phone I tried two screens but they broke after few days of use. I ordered one from amazon but that one did not fit properly on tis phone and broke within few days.

Where as the previous phone which I used was perfect over these, aspects. Dual camera is of no effect. Dolby Atmos is incredible, for this reason only I bought this phone, gorilla glass is No.1, touch, and finger print sensor is awesome. 4GB Ram rocks, in speed."

0,"I have been using this product since 20th August and its been good but not in par with the contenders like Redmi note 4 or the recently launched Moto G5s plus. But to be frank its a good phone in its way, The design is a choice of preference I like it but you may not so its matter of preference and don't forget to get a case its a slippery device. It's a bit on heavy side but its not a big deal. The display is good but I wish it could be more brighter. The built-in speaker is good,its loud and crisp(for the price), the Dolby Atmos is a gimmick I don't see much improvement when turned on or off but still its there if you want. But the built-in DAC for the headphones is on a bit of lower side I don't see it as a good one, Audiophiles stay away from this. Coming to the camera(s) they are OK but there is a need of improvement. The primary camera(13mp) is good for outdoor shots but in indoors its worse you need to go for other option if indoor is your preference, Flash can light up but you trade in for noise and you have a depth effect which uses the second sensor(5mp) at he back to add a bokeh effect and its in need for a huge improvement the edges of the subject is soft and to find the focus you will have a hard time. The video quality is good if you have enough light but there is no image stabilization so you need to have steady hands and it tops out only at 1080p at 30fps while the processor can handle 4k. The front facing camera(13mp) is good though if you are in need it has a dedicated selfie flash and it works. The battery backup is also good i get nearly 4-5 hrs of screen on time but it depends because the MTK processor in this is not that efficient but you get rapid charging which charges the phone from 0-100% in about one and half hour to two hours. The software is similar to what we get in moto devices(since moto makes these devices) so you can expect pure build of android with 7.1.1 Nougat. But I haven't seen any security updates and its on July month's patch. The performance is good for the price you are paying, I think memory management is a bit on aggressive side but its OK you can't expect much from a mid ranger. I will update the review once it is update to Android O."

1,"It can beat any phone both within same range, cost and beyond it's cost. A phone costs about 20K also can't compete with this phone. No Heating issue, extreme speed of processing, a sexy look from front side oval type glass, Hillarious sound with it's dolby atmos speaker, full water & scratch proof, the best part is the back duak camera with which you can record video in slow motion mode & can take picture in depth mode and then can edit those pictures in depth mode also. Believe me.....it's simply the best among all smart phone in it's rang & beyond it's range also."

0,"Not fully satisfied with the product due to network connection issue - Bluetooth and wifi and heating issue. Seems faulty product - Lenovo k8 Note.Bluetooth paring successfully done with wireless speaker and car's music system however the music/voice quality is not good. Music playback is neither continuous nor smooth via bluetooth, too much interval while calling though bluetooth. Screen mirroring is not possible with TV as mobile devise is unable to find the available cast screen devises(TV).Even after updating OTA update the problem still unresolved.Lenovo should rectify the issues.Turbo charger is very sluggish and took 2 hours to full charge the devise (if not used, while using it took 5-6 hours to charged fully).However the mobile looks good and rest of the feature works fine like display, calling quality, camera, touch, etc.Camera is good despite of negative review by leading technical reviewer ""phone me koi khas dam to he nai"", ""Lenovo mamu bana raha he"" etc. camera works fine as single camera, as well as in depth enable mode. camera performance is good and justify the mobile price range. (don't misguide by opinions of tech reviewer).I used Lenovo K4 Note for 18 months, and satisfied with the phone, so purchase 2 K5 note for my dad and sister and both devises works fine without any issues. I purchase k8 note but not satisfied with the product."

No use of due cameras with DSLR and this phone didn't meet my expectations as I saw in Advertisement (disappointed me). i have been using Yureka phone that has premium quality of Camera. I am feeling bad for my decision and wasted my money, I will buy some other phone. I suggest, really don't go for it.Selfie camera is also worst. Cameras does not have Real-Time Bokeh, Pro-Mode & Depth Editor etc as suggest in the Advertisement. it is completely different with all commitment.this phone does not support dual standby (4G+4G)it takes complete 2.5 hour to full charge.Battery back up is not so good.Sound is also not good."

0,"Been using it since 2days.What you get for 13k am gonna share,sincei got the 32gb/3gb variant which is enough for my usage.Looks are good sleek and slim not wide like redmi note 3/4.Venom black is good quite contrasting. can't say about other variant.Battery is moderate for 4000mah you have to charge twice if your heavy user. Yes turbo charging does work.But standby could have been better. As you have got power you gotta compromise somewhere. if it could have paired with SD 625 battery would have been promising but can't do anything now.Hardware aspect now,10 core power yes you do feel if your SD 625 user,as I was i felt it faster.Only issue i would like lenovo to improve it ram optimisation,i know it need software update or something for betterment in this aspect,i only hope lenovo delivers it fast enough because with usual 50 apps installed you will get 50-60% utelisation,in SD 625 it was somewhat lower to 45-50%. Rest you won't feel any lag or something,it just need an software update.Now focus point of these smartphone,cameras. Lets talk about the front 1st,its decent enough for selfie but not meant for poor lighting condition. in good light you will get good pics.Now Rear,13+5 normal camera works good. Also during in depth which means both lenses will be active you get some shot like slr,good innovation for budget phone but same like ram it need software updates for optimum utelisation.i love stock android,and i loved this was of stock android,though i did miss the menu button no issue its just fine replacement.I would say,for the price segment the pros are too good to let you buy one. So go for it.only issues or cons are with software,lets hope lenevo releases new patches frequently taking in mind of the users and reveiwers.And Yes Corning + 2.5D glass works like charm. kuddos lenovo.Thanks.p.s-hope lenovo checks the reviewers,to improve their product....UPDATE:AFTER 20DAYSFacing a severe issue,while kept phone for idle about 1hr or more everything works fine just,text messages you send are not being delivered,again you have to power off and turn on for it to deliver. Why the heck is that?Also the last patch update was on JULY 5TH 2017,Please kindly deliver a update soon. Today is 10sept 2017 more than 2months have passed. Kindly fix.This made me think about my choice i made on lenovo."

I have been using redme note 3 from more than a year but never faced hanging issues in chrome browser. With k8 note the browser hanged, battery drained very fast and some of the calls got dropped.By seeing at that high specification, I though this could be very good deal but this is very much disappointing. Please go for the brand which is very much trusted and having a lot of positive reviews.I request Amazon to kindly consider my request for return and refund the amount. Flipkarts return policy is much better and easy to operate."

0,Have been using the lenovo vibe k8 note for the last few days and was shocked by their warranty policy when I visited their service centre in Jayanagar Bangalore. The warranty covers only software issues only. The Gorilla glass is of cheap and mediocre quality as mine cracked on falling to the ground. The cost of replacing the panel was Rs 5500. The warranty did not cover the same. Was terribly disappointed with lenovo.

0,Hai I bought a new levono k8 note. The levono system is upgraded the battery charging very slow .Why ? What's happening? What's the solution
1,Battery backup is not goodOverall performance is good
1,Worth for your money
1,"Overall phone does well. RAM and ROM are extraordinary. Battery backup and Rapid charging is Very Good. Especially rear and front camera is superb..But when I connect it to any speakers via Bluetooth, it's very irritating. Totally disappointed in this matter. I hope that manufacturer can fix this problem in the next system update. When I listen the music via Bluetooth speakers it interrupts very much. But Lenovo K6 Power works very well when compared to K8 Note."
1,Perfect phone
1,"Here is a true review after 10 days of use,Cast screen is not working,or some good fetures like many lights indicator,data speed indicator in notification is not available like older version of lenovo notes..Some fetures is degrade instead of upgradeFront flash light is good but no results of dual cameras..But in this price this phone is very good"

1,Good phone. Battery is only prob..
1,Nice product. Loved it.The only thing which bothers is no inbuilt call recorder. But we can definitely go for third party apps for that.
1,The product recieved as it was described. Nice phone in this price range.....
0,"Overall product is good but in headset audio output is very low /poor even ordinary phone of 2-3 k range has this much output ,may be it is manufacturing defect as I used Lenovo K4 & 5 and found audio quality very good of these edition and for same reason and experience I ordered K8 Note asked Amazon for a replacement let's hope to get something positive in replaced handset . Hope Amazon will help me get a replaced one ..Will update full review and rating only after receiving replacement ...."
1,Very good phone
0,"I got the phone yesterday evening only and i am very disappointed with the product. Lenovo is such a brand and coming up with this type of phone will degrade its reputation. I bought this phone because i previously used K3 note.Following are its cons:-1) Camera is very bad, i captured a couple of pics in night mode and day mode there are really very bad with regards to clarity.2) They say its Turbo Charging but the charging is no that speedy it gets fully charged at 6hrs 30 mints. Please suggest me how can it be called Turbo charger if its so slow.3) The look is not that nice and attractive.4) It gets heat very fast.5) The battery also drains very fast and with in no time it comes to 50%.6) Sound quality they say its Dolby but no where it is near to it.I would really avoid purchasing this phone instead go for Oneplus 5 or Samsung J7. or C7."

0,"I feel cheated by lenovo.please dont buy this phone.it may have a good hardware, but stock android provided with K8 is just intolerable.let me just jot down few of the many reasons1. No inbuilt call recording facility.2. No scheduled power on/off option.3. No gallery, u have to use google's photo app instead.4. it takes a long time to show a flashy lenovo animation, which is truly a waste if time for me. u need to root ur phone to change it.5. the call log stores only last 3 call details for each caller.6. at the back, the dual camera, which boasts of capturing depth of field, is a crap. it shoots out of focus photos more often than a sharp one and only shoots in bright light.( I have thoroughly clicked many snaps with that option.)7. no inbuilt app for selecting other themes.8. battery of 4000mAh doesn't perform well. it hardly lasts 16hrs with a heavy use of internet(wifi/mobile data)9. the product comes with a clear tag 'with new system update' - but till date I have neither received any software/system update nor have I been notified about it. and I am worried if it (oreo update) brings up new issues of malfunctioning as reported widely in different forums.I feel so tired of writing these 'cons' about k8, that it will be difficult to explain its 'pro's after this.amazon has been good as always in delivery."
0,Screen cast not working
0,All features are good except the screen quality. I have kept it in my mobile pocket while driving. When I have taken it back in my hand i have seen cracks in screen. I have seen the videos saying screen is strong but it is not. For replacing screen lenovo authorised service centres are mentioning different prices in different service centre. One lenovo service centre quoted 8500. Another Lenovo service centre quoted 5800

Press back right now and look at K5 Vibe.Update : After latest update Bluetooth A2DP doesn't work."

0,"Camera click makes a big sound as if an old camera of 1950's was working! There is no ear phone cord with the package and software space left out of 4 GB RAM after minimal pre-installed software is too small. Performance is just OK. Rest of it is being explored still, as I got the delivery on 23.10.17. Charger cable is shorter this time than it has been with lenovo previously, perhaps to cut costs. Not a phone to be proud of in this price segment.Some negative features of Amazon cannot be blamed on Lenovo.Phone heats up quickly. I just checked it twice. Avoid it. I downgraded it further from "" so-so"" to ""cheap"".Sajad Ahmed"

1,It works fast
0,"Cast screen is also not working and found the same complaint From several customers on Lenovo portal all phones of K8 Sires are def and Dumb. Did a research and spoke with Lenovo Tech Agent and found this is a ""Stock Android"" OS based phone thus Customer needs to make a additional Hardware purchase for Google Cromecast Dongle to make Cast Screen, This Information they should provide while selling this. Yellow light of camera- Who makes flash light with Yellow light that's too for rear camera photographs. Amazon has Lied to me for the return of this product. Had to reset phone same day since google service was not working even other applications were also got crashed. After phone reset it is giving the same problem. Camera is very poor darn bad, don't go for this phone. With 13 mp you cannot take 16:9 photos and it's very poor feature when comes to take in depth photograph. Over all bad phone single camera is better then dual camera with 13&5 mp cameras which cannot shoot full screen or 16:9 photographs. If I could rate this experience to day as append with Amazon Rep did not even provided Supervisor that Woman rep was awful. No Quick Replacement or Exchange even I am Prime Member. Snap deal has given me replacement in 2 days with pickup and new item delivery same day. I appreciate SNAP DEAL."

0,"About Packaging and delivery :Received the phone on next day as i had paid extra for 1 day delivery but the packaging through which i received the phone was extremely poor.Able to see the phone box thoroughly from outside because of poor amazon cover packaging.About phone :I am writing this review after 3 months of usage of phone.Pros :* It has all the features you want to buy like 12 sensors, fast fingerprint detect, front flash. On april 28th 2018 received the android 8.0.0 os update.Dont know whether lenovo is going to provide further updates or not.*Battery life is of 2 and half days if mobile data is off and if mobile data is on battery will empty within 15 hrs after heavy use.*Phone built quality is good but not that great.*Camera performance is average.*It takes 2 hrs to 2hrs 30 minutes time for charging if battery low at 15 % or below. Soemtimes while charging it shows 5 hrs or 6hrs or 1day time to charge the phone.But after restart the actual charging time shows.*Sound quality due to dolby atmos is very good. Without it sound is low.*Processor and ram are good. There is no lagging observed.Cons :* Phone is giving heating issues in between and after restart its temperature gets to normal.*Sometimes called person unable to hear voice as the mic is on down side so need to bring down the phone towards your mouth to talk.Mobile signal quality is good"

The major issue which I faced was network issues for the incoming calls . For which have to return the phone to Amazon else the phone was good . Probably that defect might have been only on my handset. Anyways getting the refund so not much of worry ."

0,"Phone looks good and screen is good too. But the battery is poor. Even though it is of 4000 mAh capacity, it doesn't even last for 24 hours. Even though the brand says that there is Turbo charging, it actually takes 3 hours to charge fully. So basically you will need to charge your phone twice in a day for 3 hours each time."
1,Good handling and best technology for Motorola Ltd India is the best
0,"Don't buy this product, I brought it last year in December, just after 3 months, started having heating problems and phone turning off, then eventually it stopped working, went to service center, they said motherboard problems, but they don't have motherboard currently to change it, so after waiting for quite a few days, took it back and showed it at another place, then also not repaired, then again gave to service center, they said warranty is over as its opened outside, then i said i will pay for whatever repair there is, they said motherboard cost 14,500, THAT'S EVEN MORE THAN THE COST OF PHONE NOW, SO NOW THAT PHONE IS WASTAGE, COMPANY IS JUST NICKING CUSTOMERS BECAUSE THEY PRICED ITS PARTS SO HIGH THAT NO ONE WOULD GO FOR REPAIR, SO RECOMMEND NOT TO GO FOR THIS PHONE OR YOU WILL REGRET IT"

0,"Not at all recommended. My Lenovo K8 has the following issues:1. Poor signal strength - Tried different SIMs like Vodafone, JIO, etc, But signal shows only 2-3 bars. Whereas the same SIMs when inserted in other 4G handsets, it shows full strength n no call drops.2. Heating Problem: The company has added 4000 mAh battery because they knew that this handset will get heated and drained battery quickly. On using simple day-to-day work, it gets heated like anything. And the full battery drains within half day.3. Slow Performance: Even after introduced 4GB RAM, the handset is slow. It's not clear n not declared which type of 4 RAM they have inserted.I ordered the first day of its launch at Amazon. And one of the early users. But my overall expectations are not met... And not satisfied with the money I spent."
1,Super value for money..Al though depth mode takes time to shoot but results are good enough for a budget phone
1,A good Hardy device nicely priced.. processor ok but device gets warm when used a little heavier.... Camera good... overall a nice budget phone from Lenovo.......
1,Nice
1,"Have been using this since 3 weeks. Cool to have a deca-core processor.No lag ,no performance issues. I have not tested graphic intensive games yet. Biggest drawback for me is no direct screen cast to Smart tv unlike other competitors. Bokeh feature of the camera is not perfect."

Took the phone to the service centre they say it's a hardware issue and will take 1 week to repair. Very poor after sales support from lenovo, how can some one give their phone for repair for 1 week. I wouldnt recommend buying this phone"
1,Sabase badhiya phone

0,Headphone is not available with packing.
1,"Are u looking here ?? ..dnt worry ..its the best phone in this price range , i bought it for 12k"
0,Handset is just good can't give it 5 out of 5.Pros:1.design is awsome good looking2. Phone response is also good.3. Screen is awsome.Cons:1. It's heated on calls and charging.2. Camera effect.. Don't expect much just because of dual camera it only gives you certain option such as blur background or change it.3. 40000 mh battery is not going to help you a lot..It's not providing you a long life phone is diacharged with in 7-8 hours if you are using Internet (obviously that you will).4. Here is some problem with files stored in phone also.memory is being occupied with unnecessary things.After all I can conclude that phone is good durable good looking..But you Should not expect any magical things with it. As it's just higher than the normal smart phones.
0,1) mobile camera clarity is very poor (age detector is not available and photo date option not available)2) mobile battery back is very low3) Mobile Network Signal frequency also very bad jio sim is not work proper

0,"Totally a waste of good money. Lenovo should be banned from selling cell phones in India. The camera quality is hopeless. The Atmos feature is a gimmick, worthless even though I use Sony apk70 head phones which are some of the best. The battery drain is heavy. I bought this phone for the price and camera it offered. I am thoroughly disappointed. This is my last Lenovo product. This is not a subjective review. My A7000 was a far better performer overall."

0,Everything is fine... But camera is worst....
0,"I am writing this review after 7 months of usageIn the package: Mobile, turbo charging adapter, USB Cable, plastic case, normal screen guard, sim ejector toolCamera: Good for photos and videos in this pricing segment for daylight images. Struggles when it comes to night photography. Slow motion video recording is defiantly not up to the mark.OS: Got the system update, Lenovo keeps sending the software updates time to time. Despite keeping the software of the phone up to date the performance of the phone is not up to the mark> Phone & contacts (both are default) apps doesn't work some times takes 30 to 40 sec to load the screen> Any app be it Facebook, Instagram etc., handgs once in a day due to phone performance issues (what is the point of having 4 GB ram)> Heating issue when playing heavy games like Asphalt 8 and the app hangs giving worst gaming experienceBattery:4000 mAh battery, takes 3 hours to charge from 0% to 100% with the turbo charger provided. If you are a heavy user battery comes for 6 to 8 hours else it might come for 12 hours at max.Phone speaker: Not loud enough while playing music out, also while in traffic you can't hear the calls, absolutely not even a single word. Speaker sucks"
1,Really nice..
0,"Expect for the Ram & internal memory the function of this K8 note is far below previous K4 note which Iam using presently. The camera is very poor and Dolby Atmos function is totally useless again when compared to K4 note. I expected too much and thought will be better than K4 note in all terms. Extra features like flip phone power off, full screen photo,in built Dolby function present in K4 not available in K8. Single speaker is totally poor when compared to twin speakers in K4."

0,"There were so many features are missing, where when we compare to other lenovo phone.Battery is not much worthy and it is been mentioned 4000 mah but the battery back up is too low.there was lot of bugs were seen in one day usage itself.Finger print is working fine.camera is also good and great,design of the mobile phone is good.a dedicated memory card slot is very good and we can use both sim and a memory card. that one of the biggest advantage in thisIn overall, it is not worthy for 13k mobile, if more features are been added ,may be it can be worthy for that amount"

0,"It's a pretty decent phone. The dual camera isn't that great. Discharge rate is faster. The screen is very fragile. I have dropped my mobile only once, that too not on the screen facing side. It broke into pieces. Proper screen guards are also not available due to the screen curved design."
1,"A very good phone with ample storage and fast processor. My phone storage is now 50% full but it works just as fast! Cameras at both ends are pretty good. Depth in videos are well observed. Brightness, lack of it, is a minor drawback."

0,"It's the jack of all trades but king of none. Battery back up could have been better if they used some other processor. Battery drains quite fast. Camera is better than average. And I think there is no option to keep external media as your ringtone. Only custom build ringtones available to set as your ringtone. Kinda bums me out.Update after 3 day use:Battery back up is really horrible, normal usage like whatsapp and Instagram browsing consumes more than 25% battery in an hour or so.Then there is turbocharging issue, it starts with fast charging then after 10-20 minutes,depending upon mood, rate decreases, it took 7 hours to charge it by 40% in total.Would really appreciate if Amazon could take this matter seriously and take it up with Lenovo and return the money of its customers for defective models. I personally would not trust my 14K bucks with Lenovo or Moto from this point on."

0,Heavy
1,"At first I was worried whether to buy this mobile or not because the reviews were very bad, but I still bought it. After using this mobile for three months I realised that all those reviews were not that true. I play heavy games easily on this mobile it does not hang at all. Any device gets a little warm while working that doesn't mean that it's not working properly. The battery life is also good. There is no other mobile with so many features at so less price. I am really happy with it."
1,1. Product received on time.2. The packing of the product was not up to the mark definite scope of improvement for Amazon.3. Product received in very good condition.4. Phone working in good condition with no problem of hanging any time.5. Satisfied with camera quality both rear and front.6. Slightly on heavier side in weight and does get heated up .7. Over all satisfied with the product.
0,Pros1. Comes with a factory fitted silicon case2. Ok interface for stock Android.3. Good looking phone4. Dolby Atmos is a good inclusionCons1. Battery on single SIM lasts 12-14hrs (for a power user). A dual SIM would further reduce longevity.2. The much vaulted camera has a delayed shutter action.I used this phone after using a Redmi 3S. The K8 pales in comparison in terms of key user parameters.
0,plzz dont buy this phone if you are accepting that this phone battery will long last till a day thats not possible beacuse this phone battery drains very fast inspite of being a 4000mah battery ultimately this phone is worthless i had wasted my money plzz u dont dare to do the same this phone has heating problem too iam crying for my money know this is a dumb phone

0,"Cons:-- Major issue with Bluetooth connectivity. Gets distorted all the time, Very very bad.-- Average camera (front and back both)-- Never shows the full network range for mobile.Got this phone on 12th oct but it had major Bluetooth connectivity issue so placed a replacement on Amazon and received the replacement unit on 24th Oct which had even worse Bluetooth connectivity issue than the first unit, Finally requested Amazon for a refund, Wasted almost a month behind this useless device.Pros :-- Good Phone build quality-- Feels premium in hand-- Can use dual sim along with memory cardBuy at your OWN risk and be ready to get a taste of Amazon customer support which is very irritating and useless, No coordination between departments, I have already received my refund, But still getting calls from Amazon CC for product pickup for refund purpose.Finally, brought MiA1 which is much better device than k8 note. Build and camera quality is much much better than k8 note."

1,Fresh as lime....thnx...
0,"Turbo charging has stopped after 5 days. It takes over 3 hours to charge the phone using the official Lenovo charger. Battery backup is hardly 17 hours on full charge and low usage. The Lenovo user forum is full of complaints pertaining to battery backup of this phone. The troubleshooting steps suggested by Lenovo technical support have not helped at all.Other issues include low signal on 2nd sim ( irrespective of telecom provider), alarm not working when phone is switched off or on battery saver.The Deca core processor is extremely powerful and the phone is blazing fast. Just doesn't hang or lag. However despite having a 4000 mAh battery, the backup is appalling, making the phone completely unreliable. What is the point in having so much horsepower when there is no battery backup to power it. No wonder the phone was being sold at a steep discount.The reviews posted on Amazon are not 100% factual or accurate.Go through this link before you decide to buy the phone : https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/K8-XT1902-Smartphones/hi-guys-is-there-any-solution-for-battery-drain-issue-in-lenovo/td-p/3777078"

Back to my issue, these service centreGuys claims screen is not under warranty and you need to 5.5k to get repair of screen based on same your warranty will be re instead and then these guys will solve mic issue in warranty.

1,Good
1,It‚Äôs okay....
0,Overall the phone is good. But there is a issue with the volte on Jio as if the phone is kept idle for 10mins then you ll keep on missing calls as the other party ll get that your sim is either switched off or not reachable. This is a big flaw if the phone is volte enabled. As one can't continuosly keep on using the phone just to receive a call.A software update is required in this regards.
1,Just purchased the product and feature and working good. Batary back up comes only one day if you are not browsing much. Otherwise everything else looks good. Primary camera resolution not so high. But it's ok.

A very bad experience while receiving the phone that is no delivery, late delivery and defective product received by this particular seller.8. As features mentioned on social media about the phone are very good but according to my experience it's not up to the mark. So guys think twice before you make a purchase and make sure read all reviews from other customers too it's just my personal opinion"

0,Not good as expected. Heating too much and I faced charging issue after software update. Might be conflict between hardware and updates which clearly shows incompatible hardware. You get only 1 day battery backup and you have to keep battery saver mode on if you're not using else it drains super fast. Being Lenovo K4 Note owner I had much expectations with K8 Note though it didn't meet any of my expectation.

0,Not as expected
0,"The phone boasts a lot but is a let down. I took it with a lot of expectations cuz this phone basically combines the best of both worlds the redmi note 4 and Moto g5s plus and more. It's a Jack of all trades and a master of none (except maybe music ). The battery drains during standby and moderate gaming for like ten minutes causes it to heat up.It has Dolby Atmos Sound Enhancement and a Dedicated Music Key which is a unique feature. People who like music, might appreciate it. The fact that the Sim slot is not Hybrid is another plus point."
0,"Not so good as expected.battery backup is poor .Not worth to buy @13999 rs.It's a not a true smart phone,it's poor in functions,there r so many cons with this phone.dont buy pls.Can Amazon or seller ll buy back.I don't want this phone."

0,I am a regular customer of amazon as well as lenovo mobiles. All my previous lenovo mobiles were fine without any problem but this mobile is a disppointment because audio is very poor in the sense I am virtually unable to hear other people speak to me eventhough I have kept the call volume at the maximum. Never ever thought that lenovo and amazon would ditch me like this. I cant go in for a replacement also as I threw away the original packing and the Invoice as I was confident that this mobile also will be as good as my earlier lenovo mobiles.
1,Good mobile

So, I am not satisfied with the phone and in fact I am going to back this phone.-Thank You"

0,Received two piece of soap inside the mobile box....shameful. rating is compulsory!?
0,I like the display and working of lenovo k8 note. but to my surprise started receiving problem from day one.Cons :wi-fi problem. repeatedly disconnects and connects again.signal fluctuation in both sim. Using internet is a bit time problemAt times body heats which makes using mobile impossibleIf you buy through amazon it will be a much more tougher task to get the mobile replaced or refund. No proper responce after multiple complaints.No headset in boxpros:Good sounddisplay is much better than other phones in this price rangeBattery Backup is goodBody finishing is betterOverall good phone if there is no network issue. I strongly suggest not to buy it through amazon or anyother marketplace. Visit physical store so that you can check the phone at the time of buying.

1,Awesome phone with long battery life and good camera quality. Turbo charger really charges fast and as I'm a moderate phone user my phone's battery lasts almost whole day. I charge it only once a day and sometimes even after 24 hrs
0,"Pros & Cons explained.                   1. Very good, sleek design and elegant look, just alike iPhone 7 Plus.2. Very fast, Storage is abundant with SD Card support is a plus.3. Sim and SD Card slots are seperate.4. Very smooth to touch and Android Nougat rocks!Cons:1. Battery runs up drained too fast when connected via 4G LTE or WiFI.2. Volume is very low than you can really imagine, when played via earplugs / Wired Headsets / Bluetooth Headset or Speakers.3. No inbuilt Gallery app or a music player, so PowerAmp supports well, when purchased at $1.Rest all are great, including the delivery, which is very fast."

0,"Never buy this product- Signal Quality is poor, Cast option does not work, Bluetooth connectivity is poor sound breaks in-between, does not have option to edit pictures, Video Streaming is poor or takes times to start video. There dialing page is not user friendly, frequent dialed number are displayed in large size hence leading to unnecessary calling on frequent dialed. Camera quality is very poor and pixels break on initial zoom only. Moreover flash light nothing worst then that. Overall a bad choice in same price you can find much better device meeting your expectations."

1,Fantastic Phone in every aspect. gets charged very quickly. Amazing sound quality for high quality movies. It has dolby Atmos sound. If you enable dolby and watch movies with dolby sound you will get real theatric effect on this little phone with headphones on. Real value for money. I am really surprised by the sound quality.
1,It's an excellent piece of art based on performance and battery... But 15W turbo charger is not the right name for it's charger because it takes around 150mins to nearly 3 hours sometimes to charge the mobile

Its been only 6 months now that I am using this and I am facing such problems. Even when the charger is connected the battery continues to discharge.

0,"Hello,The phone starts resetting itself randomly. This issue starts after after 3 days of use, especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two. The issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days, then I tried few option mentioned in Lenovo help APP which is pre-installed(I am feeling like a stupid for having done this) , after that for 4 or 5 days it didn't show this issue. Now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night. Use the phone in night, then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning, boom, it is dead already. And when you manually power-on there is enough juice left in the battery. Not sure what to do with this kind of issue, the phone is absolutely useless.When I approached amazon for return, they are quoting policy and suggest me that I should run pillar to post to get problem rectified (not sure even it is rectifiable issue), The below Amazon's tagline tag-line sounds funny"" Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company."", I am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean, I am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in Amazon and now I realized that buying Lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage."

0,"Worst phone ever seen. I would suggest everyone don't ever purchase any Lenovo phones. U may get attracted by it's price and features, but they are just for name sake and not worth at all. It has various issues but the top ones being extreme heating and battery draining. It's been just 6 months I have purchased this phone and now it's fingerprint sensor is also not working as good as it was initially, network connectivity issue, extreme heating, battery draining especially after it's recent software update to OREO. A complete waste of money."

0,"Performance wise, it is worth of the cost. However is low on quite few details.Very vulnerable to accidental falls or pressure. Screen and camera glass are too cracky. Mine got few cracks and I could not even understand how it happened. To state I keep the phone with utmost care with back cover and screen guard.This lacks inbuilt contact saver.It saves in your email account.Lacks feature to personalise ringtone till you download ringtone cutter and make the ringtone.Transfer of files are tough. Personalisation of various options is not convenient. RAM usage remains always high for very basic usage with FB,Gmail,WhatsApp applications only.Adding to the above the cons as below after about 2 months usage.1.Gets hung up frequently.2.Applications including GUI gets hung.3.Finger print detection lags.4.No inbuilt contact memory. It always saves stuff in email account.5.Screen is not tough at all. Not upto the mark of gorrilla glass as specified.6. Files do not get arranged properly."

It takes minimum 4-5 hours to charge the phone. The handset gets heated up as much that you can warm your coffee cup. Within 3 days off purchase, the handset started displaying software update alert. The camera is good but consumes battery as if the handset gets hungry while photography. Not recommended until Lenovo fix the defects. Am sure, Lenovo would soon pull out the phone from market.Buy the phone at your own risk."

The moment I got the phone, I did all the transfer of credentials. After a day, I started facing this unique issue regarding loss of my data internet. It would show the 4G icone with full network strength but there was a cross sign on that network strength tower. I realised very soon that I cannot access to internet as long as that cross sign is there. I had to restart the device or wait for few hours to get the things right. This used to happen atleast 4 to 5 times in a day.So I reported this issue to amazon via app. There was an option to select the return item option but apparently that link will ask you to talk to amazon tech support or install some software for checking your phone.Amazon tech support sent a technician and all that he did was factory reset. After doing this, the phone's data internet was working fine. So accordingly he mentioned in his service report and handed over the copy to me.But immediately after he left, I started having the same issue. I reported to amazon again. This time amazon customer care team tells me that technician did not find any fault hence you have to submot more proofs.I did that as well. But there is no solution to this. I check some forum online and came to know that this is a known issue with this device. Had I known before buying, I would not have bought it at all."

1,Amazing the inbuilt is so nice and made by Motorola. This phone is combination of Moto and Lenovo. Better than any phones of Mi because their phones are not trustable.
0,AFTER 12/10/12 UPDATE I must say the battery life has improved very much Thumbs up. And the rapid charges up to 95% in two hours and 100% in 2:15 Hrs. You can use it 1.5 days normal or 1 day heavy usage respectively. Smooth running phone but there is diflections in jio network but without slowing the internet speed hope in the next update this will be corrected . Good cameras + front flash . ONE STEP AHEAD OF REDMI NOTE 4.

0,"I'll tell you what I love about the phone. Looks neat. Has curved screen edges. Loved that! And no branding logo. Love the clean looks. Love the stock android feel. Came with Android Nougat. Updated to Oreo and looks very good. Owned this for more than 6 months. Used to have camera issues which has never appeared after the Oreo update. I play PUBG with this phone every day and sometimes lags slightly which is not very much noticeable but still there. I don't keep many apps installed on my phone. I like to keep it clean and don't know how good the games would perform in a phone with tonnes of apps installed. Everythings okay except Bluetooth. Bluetooth doesn't work properly! It sucks so bad, the audio lags terribly. Tested in multiple Bluetooth headphones/speakers and still the same. Contacted Lenovo multiple times for this issue and no help. If you're a music person using Bluetooth headsets don't buy this phone, it'll irritate the s*** out of you. I'm giving one star due to poor support from Lenovo,"

0,Such a waste product. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR VALUABLE MONEY BY BUYING THIS PHONE. battery gets drained frequently. You will be required to keep the phone always in charge.
0,"Update - 28-04-2018Lenovo K8 note world wide has signal reception issues. The Lenovo service center wrote and gave me this on paper after being unable to repair my phone.My phone was at the service center for nearly 2 weeks now for signal issues. Even after changing the motherboard, the issue is not resolved.DO NOT buy Lenovo & Moto phones. If you still decide to go ahead, please visit the service center once to see the rush!(Wish I could give 0 star)The signal reception is very bad. Most of the times the same sim which functions with full signal strength on other 4G phone will give no signal on Lenovo K8 note. I have been begging Lenovo, escalated till their corporate teams and their response is not even professional.In my 6 months, my phone has spent nearly one month in the service centre with no effect. Cheap people at the service centre also. Even the systems in their service centre does not work !Buy this phone only for its camera.The phone is really heavy. The metal body will dent at the slightest impact."

0,"Lenovo is known for cheap and feature rich phone. Lenovo note is its one of the most popular phone lineup. Let's see what phone has to offer in therms of quality and performance and what are its shortcomings.ProsIt is dual sim volte 4g phone which means it will work with almost every telecom service provider.Full Metal body. In this price range very few brands are offering full metal body.Comes in two variants 3GB of RAM and 32GB 4GB RAM and 64GB GB. Both variants has enough ram and storage space.Note K8 note is using Mediatake Hellios x23 Deca Core Soc Processor this processor is very capable and its performance rivals with Snapdragon Soc.It is one the cheapest phone with dual camera with phase detect. The primary sensor is 13mp while secondary is 5mp. The camera is coupled with fast lens.Front camera is 13 mp With moderately fast lens. Both front camera and back camera has flash and they both perform well. Video and photo has enough details.Just like previous models, K8 note also has standard 5.5 inch full hd display. Screen is bright and has ample contrast.Now K8 note is using latest stock android. Stock android tends to be more responsive than modified version and has less bloatware.It has 4,000mAh battery with turbo charge support.It is water resistant.For music lovers it have dedicated music key.Audio is very clean and Supports dolby sound enhancement.Has home button and back button.Supports wifi ac band.It has dedicated card slot.Support USB On Go.Cons:-Comes without earphones.Sim and SD Insert and Remove Mechanism Needs a pin to insert or remove sim or sd card.No NFC present.No infrared support.Slow camera lens which leads to bad low light performance.Does not have either usb 3.0 or usb c.Even though processor itself support 4k video phone does not support it.Does not have enough service center. Service after sales is not adequate.Battery performance and usages average, will depend on usages pattern and apps used:-Charging time approximately 2 hours with stock charger.Web Browsing wifi and mobile data 10 hours.Only calling nothing else 20 hours.Video Playback 14 Hrs.Verdict.K8 note is a feature rich phone which follows the foot print of older device. It would be perfect device it it had 4K and dust resistant support. Nonetheless it is very competitive decide and I do recommend this phone as this phone has almost everything which will sufficient for most users. If you are looking to buy this phone I will recommend 4GB version as it offers best value for money.I hope that my review helped you. If you have any other question fell free to comment below or message me directly. I will be glad to assist you and answer all your queries."

About the camera low light photo is not that bad, what camera do you expect in this prize range, in daylight the camera is very good. About the speaker the clarity is very good.

1,This one is osm.
0,"Wish there was an option for Zero Star.The new Android Update to Oreo is not supported by the phone which is causing the phone to charge really slow after the update.Ideally, a turbocharger charges in less than an hour but this one takes more than 2 and Lenovo technical support is also full of lame and dumb people who will tell you that the charging should take 1 hour and 40 minutes (that is what a normal fast charger does and not a turbocharger).buy any other phone that already has an oreo update."

It has a deca core processor but still it lags with Snapdragon 625 processor increasing cores will not result a better performance, no signal stability for volte, the price which they took is not worth device i got.Too much costly phone but does not have and support basic features with apps even, no call recording feature even with playstore app it only record one side speaking person who have the phone but not of other side, does not support to use custom tones as ring tones, no stable 4g Volte network, battery performance degrade very soon as compare to other smart range phones even having a 4000 MAH battery very disappointing product i purchase, lenovo k4 note is far better than this one dumb product."

It means not enough volume, no clarity not able to hear the incoming calls sound also. Very worst and worst sound. So i've called Amazon, they asked me check via 'smart chk' app. That is one of the fraud app. It shows everything working in good condition. But i sure that there is defect in the loudspeaker of my K8 note. Amazon like trustworth company, better shouldn't sell mobiles company like ""lenevo"". Then only it can maintain credibility from custolers. Very worst quality."

0,I bought this phone and regret my decision. I bought this over redmi note 4 just because of camera but the dual camera sucks it gives very artificial bokeh effect. And there is no option to turn off vibration for notifications as of now. I hope lenovo will provide an update for camera and some bug fixes. But lenovo is notorious for not providing updates even for phone priced higher than this devices.

0,"This is a terrible product. I'm highly surprised that Lenovo can make a such phone. Received the phone 2 days ago. There is a network problem - it does not show any signal most of the time. When connected with BT to car for audio, the music keeps on hanging. Further, the phone keeps on hanging when multiple applications are in use.Such a waste of money.

Extremely dissatisfied with the product.Last time when I purchased the Dell monitor I was very much Happy and satisfied with the product. But this time its complete opposite.In the return section I was asked to download the Application for checking and analysing the problem but shocking it gave ""PASS RESULTS"" which is actually not correct.I request Amazon to return my money and take back the product.Hope Amazon doesn't break the customer and provides fair treatment to the customer"

0,MAJOR PROBLEM IS PHONE CHARGING....EVERY 12 HOURS IT REQUIRED CHARGINGPHOTOS ARE ALSO NOT UPTO THE MARK..
0,Normal
0,Device was delivered to me on 16th sept and with in a span of one week it had issue of restarting again and again while in usage (in idle too). Approached the service center with the same... they took 4 days of time and returned me back saying there wont be further issues but in less than two days of their service mobile started behaving the same... still the mobile is in service center....Finally my suggestion...Before making a decision of buying a Motorola / lenovo mobile please visit their service center near by. By seeing the number of people carrying their new mobiles.. you can come to conclusion that its waste of money first then waste of time approaching them.

0,"Indian mobile sector is dominate by two kind of manufacturer, one who are capable of big marketing budget and another who offers mobile at cheap price. Lenovo is known for feature rich phone. Lenovo note is its one of the most popular phone lineup. Let's see what phone has to offer in therms of quality and performance and what are its shortcomings.ProsIt is dual sim volte 4g phone which means it will work with almost every telecom service provider.Full Metal body. In this price range very few brands are offering full metal body.Comes in two variants 3GB of RAM and 32GB 4GB RAM and 64GB GB. Both variants has enough ram and storage space. 4GB version offers best value for money.Note K8 note is using Mediatake Hellios x23 Deca Core Soc Processor this processor is very capable and its performance rivals with Snapdragon Soc.It is one the cheapest phone with dual camera with phase detect. The primary sensor is 13mp while secondary is 5mp. The camera is coupled with fast lens.Front camera is 13 mp With moderately fast lens. Both front camera and back camera has flash and they both perform well. Video and photo has enough details.Just like previous models, K8 note also has standard 5.5 inch full hd display. Screen is bright and has ample contrast.Now K8 note is using latest stock android. Stock android tends to be more responsive than modified version and has less bloatware.It has 4,000mAh battery with turbo charge support.It is water resistant.For music lovers it have dedicated music key.Audio is very clean and Supports dolby sound enhancement.Has home button and back button.Supports wifi ac band.It has dedicated card slot.Support USB On Go.Cons:-Comes without earphones.Sim and SD Insert and Remove Mechanism Needs a pin to insert or remove sim or sd card.No NFC present.No infrared support.Slow camera lens which leads to bad low light performance.Does not have either usb 3.0 or usb c.Even though processor itself support 4k video phone does not support it.Does not have enough service center. Service after sales is not adequate.Battery performance is similar to Moto G5s. Battery performance depends on background application, temprature, brigtness and usages pattern.Charging time approximately 2 hours with stock charger.Web Browsing wifi and mobile data 10 hours.Only calling nothing else 20 hours.Video Playback 14 Hrs.Verdict.K6 note is a feature rich phone which follows the foot print of older device. It would be perfect device it it had 4K and dust resistant support. Nonetheless it is very competitive decide and I do recommend this phone as this phone has almost everything which will sufficient for most users. If you are looking to buy this phone I will recommend 4GB version as it offers best value for money.I hope that my review helped you. If you have any other question fell free to comment below or message me directly. I will be glad to assist you and answer all your queries."

Else phone is a breeze... Go for it. Better than me and honor 9 lite.Dual camera at the back and selfies are better than latest mi... I used to love mi selfies but Lenovo turned it around...I had a k5 note earlier... K8 note has better gui and smooth operation...Forget vivo and oppo as well... The best in the class with a gorilla glass!!!
1,I use this from 2 months. All most phone performance is good. Also good for gaming. No hanging problem. There is only 1 problem in Dolby atom. But in this price phone is too good. Bad thing is that in box u can get only phone and charger nothing else.

0,Not as expected
0,"(I've had this phone for 5 weeks now.)The phone comes with a clear hard case (I'm pissed my case came PRE-scratched and strangely stained) and no accessories except for the turbo charging adapter+USB cable.1. The primary camera is alright - I used to own a Mi3 (2014!!!) and this compares with it, which doesn't make it all that good for 2017. But good enough. I haven't tinkered with the depth enabled mode but I know it isn't flawless.2. The phone may seem a bit too heavy the first day or two. [I'm just glad I haven't dropped it on my face YET :( ]3. The front camera is pretty good - all things considering - and won't make you look too ugly, you'll end up with bright adequate selfies.4. I haven't had any heating issues like other reviews have mentioned, during heavy usage or while charging.5. The battery life is great and will last you nearly the whole day, unless you have the brightness on Max, the WiFi is on, SIM is enabled and you're continuously watching videos.6. Although there is only one speaker i.e only on the bottom, thanks to Dolby the sound is loud clear and pretty great.7. The headphone jack IS a tad annoying, you really have to push your headphones in.8. Turbo charging   around 2 hours, faster if you aren't using the phone at all and it's on airplane mode.9. Honestly, Stock Android pisses me off. I'm used to and love MiUI.10. I got my phone in the very first flash sale (Aug 25) so I had to settle for the 3GB/32GB version and it's adequate.11. The call quality is good enough.12. This phone isn't all that great at catching WiFi signals sometimes though, my 2014 Mi3 does better.All in all, it's a pretty good phone, definitely won't let you down (a lot) when you really need it to come through.But at this price range, you could probably do better. Also keep in mind returning the phone will be next to impossible."
0,"Don't buy any Lenovo mobile in your life ! I have visited Lenovo service center 4 times in 5 months after puchase which i baught @ 13,999 rupees, but after 5 days it became dead after every few days continusly, the service center guys are very rude and not co-operative.

0,"Worst phone ever. I did not even want to rate it a star. The phone gets very much heated up. And the the charging doesn't stay for long, though there's a turbo charger with this device. Device is not worth taking. Better go for Mi redmi note 4. They say Mi blasts and heats up,but it is said only so that the MI market comes down, it's a cheap trick that are usually played by other competitors. I bought lenovo k3 note a year ago and it has network issues that were never been corrected by the service centre. And three months ago I bought another lenovo, lenovo k8 note, which is utter waste like k3. I gave my phone to service centre in Jayanagar, and instead of repairing it, they broke the back cover of the phone which is non removable cover. This was experience with this Product.So before you choose a product please do read the reviews."

0,"After 4day I write my true reviews by comparison of mi note 4 vs Lenovo k8, forgot that last month my friend is brought a mi note 4 and I chose to by k8 note, hance I write my true reviews,Profomance- k8 and mi 4 booth are same nothing feel changes,Battery backup- after full charging mi is better storage battery power.Gaming reviews- booth mobile is heating when I play clash of clan on online.Charging- after 15 min of charging mobile is heating, I think this is turbo charger issue of k8 note,Mi charging- when my friends mobile put in charging it beeping means on and off continuesly. That's a bad reviews by of mi note 4Front camera-k8 front camera is best then mi,Back camera- booth looks same.Display resulation and quality of display- k8 is good,If you talk about design k8 is better then mi but waight is more.Flashlight- mi back flash is good then k8, but front flash is good k8, it looks like Sony front camera.K8 is splash proof and gorilla Glass that's better then mi,When I using video calling front flash is not on means front flash option is not given on k8.After all things finally I gives 3* from k8 and 2* from mi...... Mi is bad charging issue is so so bad..... Short circuit issue may probably coming in next... Thanks to all who read my reviews I can't judge you but I hope you won't not buy Hopper mobile mi, in 1month it's issue is coming looks his future..."

0,Charging drains away very fast .Takes too long to charge. Don't know y is it called turbo charger. Depth effect for name sake. Heavy. Dual cam waste. 10 core processor name sake.No audio recording.

0,"Phone heating and usual battery drain after Oreo update****************************************************************Everything was great till the Oreo update arrived. If you are in doubt, search for K8 Note Oreo update and you will learn for your self.After Oreo update, the mobile always keeps hot even if its idle. You can't even pickup the phone and put it to your ears. Hope someone doesn't get hurt due to explosion of this phone.The battery drains very fast. Before oreo update battery used to last for 2 days for me, but now it doesn't even last 3-4 hours. Its even getting worse day by day.Due to heating not able to put the phone in pocket or even not able to keep it on ear when call comes, even if phone was idle since hour. The phone is still in warranty and Lenovo has no clue what's happening.Wish I am able to roll back the Oreo update or return the phone.If you haven't bought the phone yet : Wait till these issues get resolved.If you have already bought : DONT UPDATE TO OREO.If you have alreay updated to Oreo : God help you(like me), and start saving for another phone.Hope this helps and save people from getting burnt (literarry) by the phone.-Anup"

Camera response also very slow.Depth mode is givien in camera but useless as after taking snap you have to edit photo and editing tool is also poor. Audio quality is average. Not satisfied. Not worth of money. Better handsets are available in same price.

Camera quality is not upto the level. looks good. only drawback is the turbo charger is not at all good, it took 5.5hrs for the battery to full from 7% and no where its called turbo. battery back up is little fine. for 14k you cannot expect many features,overall its worthy."

0,"Got the mobile on first sale. Of the main aspect of the phone on which Lenovo was emphasizing was dual rear cameras is not good at all. The depth enabled mode is totally of no use neither is the depth editor. All other aspect of the mobile is ok. A honest suggestion is to wait for mi 5x or Coolpad cool play 6 . The web support of Lenovo is also of no use. Raised a ticket on this issue still no answer or reply from them. God knows whether they ever see to mails or not. I made the mistake of buying this phone, all of you out there please dont make my mistake"

0,"Very bad camera Quality with this price range , front camera capturing only mirror image.Plz don't buy to see it's deca core processor and 4gb ram & 64 gb rom features if you want good photography mobile."
0,"TL;DR: This phone sucks, expected much better from the makers of Moto. Even Moto G5+ is far better than this.Long version:My previous phone broke so I was in urgent need for a stopgap phone before waiting out for the price of LG G6 to drop. Shortlisted Honor 6x, Lenovo Z2 and Lenovo K8 Note. Bought this, after 10 days of use here is what I thinkPros:+ Photos are decent (compared to my last two phone that promised great camera but delivered little). The bokeh effect is not as good and Huawei's implementation.+ No bloat. It has stock android. Now stock android's blocky icons aren't my favorite but you can change that with a launcher.+ Programmable music button. I use that for turning on the flash light.+ Front flash+ Dedicated SDcard slot.Cons:+ Lag. Despite a deca core processor and 4GB of RAM, this piece of fine machinery is lagging, not on an intensive game like asphalt but Clash Royale. Even my mom's Redmi 3 will run that flawlessly.+ Battery. Another indicator that numbers don't always match the performance. I gotta charge it twice a day. And I miss fast charging.+ Notification LED: Only white, not red or green, but only white. No LED flash for Missed calls, the most important use of that LED.+ Software. In many little ways, the software seems much less integrated with the hardware compared to even Moto."

0,"Updated review after posting it on 31st January for the updated issue read the last 2 pointsNote :- The review is been posted after using this smartphone for 6 days after I bought it through Amazon Independence SaleDespite having such a wonderful hardware configuration in this smartphone there are lot's of software bugs which ruined this phone even after the latest updates which I have listed below, I hope Lenovo provides a stable software through future updates :-1) All incoming messages in the phone are delayed by 10-20 minutes like all OTP messages or any kind of messages which made me annoyed especially while doing bank transactions.2) Random Power off issue. Phone gets randomly switch off while charging or while turning off the display by pressing lock button3) Battery backup is very poor I guess this is a hardware issue not a software issue because phones like Redmi Note 4 gave me almost a full day battery backup has I'm a heavy user and this phone gave me 7 hours of battery life it seems like Lenovo has cheated us by giving a label of 4000 maH battery backup which I think is only 2500 maH battery installed in this smartphone.4) Dual camera setup is just fake especially the depth mode from that 5 MP depth camera, in short it's just for name sake that this phone comes in dual camera setup.As far I have encountered only these 4 issues if I face more issues will update my review till then go for Mi A1 or Redmi Note 4 has per your budget atleast those phones have a stable software configured with their phones hardwareUpdate :-5) Phone gets hang very badly while doing multi tasking though having deca core processor you can only run maximum 4 to 5 apps in background what a joke seriously right, to overcome this hang one should do hard restart by pressing the power button for 10 to 20 seconds6) Another software bug is with notification light which is single white colour. No RGB notification light found in Redmi Note 4, but the true software bug is this notification light only works for pre installed applications on this phone. That means notification light won't blink for third party applications like Whatsapp, hike etc. But the notification light will blink for messages calls and gmail apps, another software joke from LenovoNote:- If I face more issues will update my review"

0,Waste of Money and Time.. Brought this product recently. Not working properly with Android 8.0 update. Phone is discharging in minutes and taking more than 7hrs hours to 100% charging. While using the mobile its heating like a iron box...totally hated the product then Amazon replaced the product with a new device and again faced the same problem...service centres are also not answering properly. One of my friends also brought the same phone before 3 months. He updated the system to Android Oreo 8.0 and then the hell started in his device. We went to the device centre and asked to take the backup of our personal data for resetting the phone. We did it and handed over the device to them. In the evening they called us and told that the problem was rectified and asked us to collect the device. But the next day the problem repeated even more aggressively than earlier. Then we went again to the service centre and again explained the damn story. Then they changed the battery and gave us the phone back. But the next day again the problem repeating. So we finally went to them and asked them to replace the device with a new one but they said there is no such option to replace the defective problem and they can not help with the device problem. Finally one of the technician in the service centre told us that the problem is for all the K8 note devices after updating to Android Oreo 8.0. Then we asked him to degrade the Android version to Nought 7.1.1. Then he said they doesn't have the option to degrade the system update and told us that he'll inform when the degrade option is available with them. It has been 1 week since he told us. But till now we didn't received any patch for this system update or degrading option. So I suggest you guys please stay away of your thoughts of buying this product....have a good day...

0,"After using this mobile phone for one month, I am writing this review.The main issue of this product is heating.During charging or even using it for fifteen minutes raises the temperature by at least 10 kelvin.The turbo charger is not good enough.Also the touch buttons below the screen are not back lit.Camera is just average. Low light performance is very bad.Design could have been better. Little bit thinner would be good.I think it's just an experimental product from Lenovo.I don't suggest anyone to buy it.I feel that Lenovo should immediately stop selling this product and recall all of them from the market ASAP.If there is any way to return it, then kindly let me know.MI A1 is far better at the same price range."
0,Battery drain problem.... Otherwise it is ok
0,Lenovo K8 note is above from any other sub15k range smartphones from lenovo but average in overall ratings. And little bit of heavy .lill bit of heating with continues usage .camera department is above of any other smartphones of this range but exception is it's dual camera setup which is only a hardware setup in smartphone but software is not that much supportive wuth dual camera setup. Front flash is soft and quite good.Stock android is impressive with it.Processor is not battery efficient as 4000mah not last long for a day. 4000mah battery is good on paper but in day to day life it is somewhere 3200mah.Build and looks are impressive.LED notification light is point to consider.Considering K8 note as a multimedia smartphone is fare ti rate it. Sound Quality is good display experience is also good as well.Dual Sim and dedicated SD card slot is nice effort with the fone.Dedicated music key is Good to have and ability to enable it for various operations is appreciabl.Fingerprint security is only upto lock unlock but you can't let it to secure any of your apps without any 3rd party apps. yes it works in capturing pictures through camera.Stock android is that much basic that even you can't hide apps in app drawer. It looks good but feels little less that even yiu can't hide unnecessary apps.
0,The phone is slow than Lenovo K8 Plus. K8 Plus is better.
1,rear camera depth mode and bokeh effect is not up to mark as expected.heat up[ while turbo charging and gaming.
1,It's good.
0,"Over Heating Issue while light usage like just in internet connection, and always warm while connected to internet. this update is After usage of 10 days. Dont prefer this one."
0,Good
1,nice phone
0,"The screen is not like Gorilla , it's display broken very early."
0,"Pros1) finally the Camera is awesome in Lenovo2) Deisgn is not a merit but it's okay for cost3) so far smooth performance didn't hanged.Cons1) If you are staying in hill stations as usual Lenovo is carrying the exothermic mechanism which liberates enough heat to keep your hand extra warm2) Turbo charging really works good but the bad thing is battery doesn't make you to feel 4000mah. Just stands for 5 to 6 hours of jio use3) Stock OS lacks lot of customization features that were available with earlier versions. The OS is just basic (Raw) no value addition had been done.4) Lenovo should concentrate on network ic (signal receiver) never shows full tower. So network consumes so much power I think so5) No headset? I mean, really? This is absolutely madness.6) speaker is of low quality"
1,Don't believe any fake review. This is the best phone in this price range. No heating problem. No problem at all. Buy it as soon as possible.
0,The mobile is not good as it is shown .it has Network problem& also toch performance is poor
0,Battery backup is average. Screen guard can not be install properly because of its corved display.
0,"Received the used piece, all the application were pre installed and you can see the images I've posted, (on Aug 29, 2017, received msg from Vodafone customer care).Note: Today only I received the mobile and last Saturday I ordered the mob i.e on 21st Jan, 2018.Before buying anything from this seller pls check weather you received the new product or the used one, anyway I've raised the complaint regarding this let me see what's going to happen."
0,There's no cast option in the phone.Which has to be present .Something seems wrong with the cameraThe video doesn't have many options.
0,Handset is looking good. Camera is not so good its ok. Battery backup very poor ya I know there is big big ram latest processor but it's too much drain fast while I am just whats app chatting. And turbo charger is very slow it look like ordinary charger. For 50% it's took 5 hours. And one more thing I don't have any kind of game or i m not playing it online but battery drain more than expectations. Its not worth price. It is best for ‚Çπ 8000/- max ‚Çπ 10999
0,AMAZON service is Superb. Lenovo K8 Note is an average product. There is no inbuilt GALLERY in it and there is no MORE RINGTONE OPTIONS of our choice other than inbuilt Ringtones. I am disappointed by purchasing this mobile.
0,1)charging issue taking 15 hours for full charging2) music button working as simultaneously3)touch performance low4)fast discharging not worth of 4000mah
0,"the built quality is good and also the texture is fine. but the main problem is the phone is lagging little bit and the dual camera(depth mode) isn't good.Now come to the point- 1) LAGGING ___ the phone start to lag after the first boot up. when i was doing multitasking the phone start to lag. the phone is running on Android v7.1.1 Nougat operating system with 2.3GHz Helio X23 10-core processor and 4GB-64GB of ram though the phone is lagging so much.Now come to the second point 2) CAMERA____ the front facing camera is good and the back camera is also good but the dual camera mode, i mean the depth mode is very bad, the dual camera couldn't recognise the item that's why it blurs the whole item and its the biggest problem in this phone though they are providing us a DSLR-like depth-of-field effect. One camera has a 13 MegaPixel PureCel Plus sensor, bringing in high-end imaging capabilities. The other has a 5 MegaPixel sensor, which simultaneously captures depth information. This means you can view real-time bokeh with up to F/1.2."
1,Excellent product by Lenovo.4GB RAM 64 GB ROM - enough as per my requirement.Camera is good. Picture Quality is Good.Sound Quality is also good.Battery life is Ok.No problem with the phone as of now.

0,"This phone is hyped as a decacore high performing phone but in reality my old K5 Note is faster. Two major problems that I noticed so far - audio on bluetooth breaks up very frequently and this is not isolated to my phone - do a quick search on Lenovo forums and you'll see that this bug is in every K8 Note and Lenovo hasn't bothered to fix this. Also, if you plan to screencast - you're in for a surprise. This feature isn't there and you'll need chromecast to screencast - Lenovo says that this is as per design. This is not because of a hardware limitation. Some people have enabled this feature by rooting their phone and adding some 3 lines of code which lenovo can add easily, only because Google wants to promote chromecast, this has been removed."

0,Very bad smart phone
0,Mobile is bit bulky and heavy. No backlit for the navigation icon on screen. It would be better if it is slightly slim. Compared to redmi note 4 this is alot better but only thickness is a big concern for me. Not an easy fit in pocketMajor concern is battery drains very fast. No use even if 4000mah

The drain time is drastically more in comparison to charge time."
1,Processor is quite powerful which does great job and phone doesn't hang even on heavy usage but down side is it consumes more battery which feels 4000 mah as 'Ok' option rather than great. Camera quality is good. Overall deserves 5 star.

0,First time very bad experience with lenovo. Bad display quality no gorilla glass protection scratches coming on display.. and important app are missing like gallery and many more...I'm boycotting Lenovo.
0,"This is the first time I am reviewing a mobile as I wanted to help the others before buying this phone. This phone is good for a budget of 14k, I have bought 64gb, 4gb ram model. After a week usage I see the Ram speed, browsing net, switching to different apps is really fast. No doubt the interface on Android ver7, it's a great user experience. But there is a major problem with the battery as plenty of them have mentioned on their comments. Lenovo claims it is turbo charging but it takes minimum of 2 hours to charge or sometimes it varies,, close to 3 hours as well. Battery draining quickly is a terrible product defect. I have an issue when the battery indicator level comes to 15%, it goes to 2% in less than 3 minutes and it shuts down. I have highlighted the issue with a video evidence to Amazon and fighting for a replacement of phone or refund, not sure if the same battery issue repeats to my replacement phone as well. I am also planning to post a video of this issue in YouTube. In general a 4000 mah capacity battery should stand for at least 2 days with a minimum usage or 1.5 days with a decent usage, but seeing the comments from most of buyers, I think this is a manufacturing defect and lenovo should really see this issue, get it addressed immediately. If you ask my opinion, wait for few days, revisit the new comments posted by the buyers and once the battery issue stands resolved, then go for it. End of the day what's the point of buying a mobile with a battery issues? it's like buying a vehicle with fuel injection issues,, it will not last long!"

Not good for high end games I mean I use normal games like 8ball pool and this phone couldn't even run that game smoothly and felt glitches and lags every time during the gameplay and spoiled the experience of it. My iPhone 4s plays better 8ball pool better then this phone.Being a normal user I ignored it and now let's talk about the camera. The shutter speed of clicking the pictures is the worst I have seen and the quality of pictures isnt that great, It felt like a high end VGA camera and the panorama pictures are the WORST - WORST.I don't know what the YouTube reviewers saw in it for their biased reviews.2 stars from my side for it."

It could have been a great mobile but lacks few features like screen cast (only through Chromecast), camera can be improved for low light, memory and power could be better.

0,I am writing this review after using almost 10 months. Before I was using Moto G2 which was good but became old and slow overtime. Then I wanted to buy better phone with good camera. The specs of Lenovo K8 Note tempted me to buy mainly duel camera and fast charging. I was expecting better camera phone but disappointed a bit and could not achieve my goal :( Overall phone rating is average.
0,Defective product provided by Amazon
0,"I am posting this review after a week of usage.First of all lots of people problem is to go with this one or Redmi note 4 . So I have used both the device . The only difference between this one and rn4 is battery backup . You'll get around 8 hours of sot in rn4 but only around 5 to 6 hours in k8 note.Other than that all the aspects are definitely better in k8 note. And there is also fast charging in this one which charges fully in 2 hours without using the device if you are using then definitely charging will be much slower.If we consider k8 note alonePros areDual camera (If only there is an update in future to improve)Fast chargingDisplay (All mobiles in this price segment maybe fhd. But this one is slightly better)Dolby AtmosStock Android Superb fluidity (Definitely Lenovo done a great job by removing their ui and goes with stock)Theatre max ( If u are person who is watching lots of Hollywood movies this is best feature)Cons areI experiencing Heating issue while charging and playing (But not too much I think it's manageable)Difference in battery backup ( sometimes I'm getting 6 hours of sot and sometimes around 4 to 5 hours ..But I suggest you to install Greenify for more better battery backup)Unwanted second camera if there is no further updates for cameraThose are the cons I found till nowFinally there are the problems like camera and battery but those can be solved via OTA so I am eagerly waiting for updates.For 14k I'll definitely suggest this one over rn4 , Moto g5 plus and Honor 6x.Im disappointed now that is more than a month no proper update for camera and battery backup is getting worse...so i suggest u guys to ignore this one"

But when you first try to update, it update and update and update for so many times (not data speed issue) for various versions of update.-So Called 13+5MP dual back camera and 13MP front facing camera are useless!-The so called 4000mAH battery does not lasts longer with very normal usage. no videos games etc. Who has opened the non-removable and seen whether it is a 4000mAH.NEVER BUY THIS MOBILE PHONE."

If you go to contacts and click on any contact the screen goes blank and you cant open the contact.2. Mirroring function is not there, so if you want to do mirroring on your TV or projector its not possible3. Bluetooth doesnt work, the phone is not searchable by any other bluetooth device or it cant search any active bluetooth device4. Camara is ok nothing great to have duar camara at the back, and front camara has average result.5. Charging takes long time in some sockets, dont know why.6. Front sensorts are not that great.My overall verdict is if you can get a better option at this price then go for it."

Turbo charger takes up to 45 mins to fully charge the phone as opposed to advertised 15 mins.Good for users who are looking for budget phones with good camera and using it for organising their work etc.The lack of earphones makes it not so enjoyable for watching movies , videos- inspite of a good display."
0,Not worth of it's money
0,"Don't buy. This phone has heating issue. Try Ur luck if u want and may be this works good for u. Amazon return policy is very bad for mobile device. Once u complain for defective product, they will block Ur number and u won't be able to call them again for replacement or refund. U will have to write mails for which no revert will come. In return option they will ask to install an app which will always tell that Ur phone is ok. My sincere suggestion is that don't buy from Amazon any mobile device. I appreciate Flipkart or snapdel as they return without any question if Ur product is not good. My phone touches 40degree when I start taking and they since the temperature is less than 48 it's ok for use. Nonsense."

Talking about the conversion between you and other person.2) Can't add contact of A person via SMS, if you want to sent A person contact to B person.3) No inbuild gallery of Lenovo4) Inbuild File manager is hopeless. You can't copy paste.5) Screenshot option not available in mobile. You have to press down volume button and power button.6) Speaker quality is good as it has dolby as compare to MI mobiles.8) Not able to select comfortably other person in conference.9) Not able to select multiple people if need to send same message to many7) Not a user friendly mobile."
1,All good but hitting issue is the problem.
1,Nice phone. But some app. Like gallery r not shown on display. But shown only on watsapp. Overall gud phone.
0,"Bad experience, Battery decharging quickly and it takes too much time to charge"
0,Phones are getting slimmer but bend are not covered in warrenty.After using the phone for 4 months a huge bend occur in the handset but service center saying bend problem is not covered in warrenty hence cannot help.So my question is for Lenovo why company is making thinner mobiles with big screen if customer are facing this type of problem and if company will continue doing so the bend problem should also covered in warrenty.Bad experiance.More over my vol. - button stoped working and after rushing to service center i come to know that it get broken and service center denied to replace the same in warrenty and giving bull shit reason that its damage hence not covered in warrenty.So my question is what is covered in warrenty?I could have give .5 stars if option available.Think 1000 times before buying Lenovo product because there was lots of people like me struglling to get their mobiles repaired under warrenty.
1,Awesome phone... reasonable and effective. I alwaz recommend this product.
0,Huge network issue with this model
0,Dont look for hardware but software version used by Lenovo on this K8 Note model is worst. This software has lack basic functionalities like Theme and other basic features you can find in Samsung. Even cast option is not working. Defect in the latest operating system. No change in handling this mobile even K4 Note is better than K8 Note. I have upgraded this mobile to latest Nogut os version 7.1.1 but no help and future version 8.0 Oreio will available in next Diwali 2018. So there is no effort by LENOVO. Worst quality product by Lenovo. Better to go for Samsung
0,Performance not as expected. Lots of bugs for blutooth. many times hangs while playing games. Less frequent updates. Screen burning is another issue.
0,"Dont buy this phone from amazon.after purchaseing a lot of problem occured like battery back up too weak,heating issue not solved and headphone not support.I had mailed on amazon with service report card but no helpful reply from them.they do not return/replace this item.too much worst experience from amazon.never purchase electronic items like mobile or tablet from amazon."
1,"Good battery performance. Delivers a full day of duty for a relatively high usage of mail box, net usage, and social surfing. Response of the OS and equipment is in line with the expectation. Speakers are good. After the stunning results I get on my MotoZ, it is only natural that I do. It find the results of the camera in line with my expectation ! Overall, a fantastic value for money !"

0,Heating problem battery back up poor takes 8 hrs to get charge third class product don't waste money

I loved previous Lenovo's K4 note phone before but now they changed their product's quality. Also their Service centre's staff are not professional. They don't have even basic Knowledge about possible issues in phones and they compare service with Samsung and Iphone. Lol..

0,"I will never recommend to buy this product from Amazon. It started giving problem after 20 days and Amazon has refused to accept the return policy as their so called return window was closed. When I visited customer service center, they informed me as there is a display problem, you have to pay 5,000 for repairing. This means that the phone was defective which Amazon supplied to me."
0,"1. Though advertised as Jio compatible being LTE, does not WORK with Jio Sim. most of the time. We have made 3 visits to Jio and after that, sometimes it works, sometimes not. Sometimes Jio calls work, sometimes JioNET sometimes neither! You want a phone with 2 sims and it should be dependable, but not this one. You cannot trust it and take it with you and be sure that you can make/receive a call when you want it.2. Turbo charging does not work - of course with the charger and the cable provided3. Heats up quite a lot. Gets very hot even when not in use.Recommendation: DO NOT BUY TILL Lenovo FIXES THESE."

0,Please do not purchase this product. I have k3 and k5 and k8 note. The sound quality of k5 is awesome but k8 note has worst sound quality. Don't waste your money.
0,"Good phone but bit overpriced. Internet is full of reviews and specs so will not repeat it. Following is the list of pros and cons from myside.Cons :-1) Gets warm while playing simple games like Candy crush tho no problem watching videos and listening to music.2) Personally I didnt find Stock android OS that great. I am in favour of few customization and features options from manufaturer. Customization options are very limited. Major put off for me.3) Unread message badge counter for notification is missing. So if ur phone is on silent and u hv disabled notification u wont b able to know how many messages are unread in whatsapp, sms, facebook etc. You hv to manually open the each app and check the status now and then.4) No separate option for monitering Call and Message notifications Ringtone. If u lower or mute call ringtone message tone would also be reduced or mute as the case may be.5) No ultra power saving mode option.6) No NFC, Infrared, IR Blaster and Screen mirror options7) Key board typing is not so smooth and lot of time i hv to edit wht i keep typing at high speed8) Double tap to wake phone takes time9) Battery hogging. Even being 4000 mph battery it runs out in 7-8 hours flat compared to Redmi Note 4 which gives more than a day battery life10) Very heavy n bulky. Feels like u r carrying a small iron rod in the pocket.Pros:-1) Blazing fast speed to open and manage all apps2) Premium Look with all metal finish3) Display panel excellent4) No hybrid sim slot. Means u can use 2 sims and one memory card5) Good RAM management6) Dedicated music key with customization optionPersonally I would not recommend this pure stock android phone to anyone. Better options like Redmi Note 4, Moto G5 + with similar specs available."

1,Guys i am an engineer so writing this review after long study. Phone hardware is absolutely awesome. However this is stock Android so you can't expect extra.

I.e. approx 6000.Other disappointed things seems in Lenovo K8 Note it is over heating problem and also it's heat when pH is charging.

0,I am happy to using Lenovo k8 note
0,The Lenovo K8 note is having major issues with network reception. It doesn't work on 4G. The same sim card works fine on Redmi note 4 and Mi 4i.Lenovo works only when manually select 2G which is pathetic.Amazon Blancco diagnostic app says everything is fine but photo inbuilt status shows no signal.it show 0signal strength.Amazon is fooling customer. After a huge fight I got my phone replacement but they didn't provide refund. Now with replacement phone it doesn't provide option to refund or further replacement. You are only lucky 1 time if your phone is damaged or doesn't work.Lenovo must provide fix and Amazon must improve on customer service.

1,This a good mobile and having great performance

1,It's a great phone.
0,"With lot of expectations went for the phone.The finish was so good and it was light weight. The android 7 was neat and the phone. Didn't face any lagging or heating during my initial use.The disappointment was more on the turbo charging and especially on the camera. The turbo charging was not as quick as I had expected so that was a bit disappointing. Still a decent speed and we can live by it.The camera experience was one of the worst that I have come across in the five years. I am not sure if it was a bad piece I received or k8 note itself is of such low quality. In past I have used nexus 5, meizu note 2, Redmi note 3 and Moto g4 plus and when compared to those mobiles the camera specifications were a bit high in this. One of the major reasons I went for this one was for the camera specs it boasted of. Sadly all pics either in depth mode, hdr, or even normal mode were of very very low quality. I would rate the camera 1/10.If you are not worried about the camera then you can go for it. I have returned my phone alreadyP.S: Again I am not sure if my piece was a fault one but as far as my experince goes this is a total waste of money purely for the worst camera experince."

0,I have purchased Lenovo K8 note. This product is really disappointed me it is missing the basic CAST future. Even 4000 rupees mobile is having this feature but Lenovo is missing this Basic concept. They are suggesting to purchase a chromecast to Cast the screen. it is not worth because recently every TV is coming with the smart future with advanced features in built for the casting. Lenovo has to take it on priority and need to release the update. With out cast feature this mobile is really waste of money and better to choose other mobile.

0,"What I didn't like :This cell phone was running smooth till the time I started getting updates.After the recent updates , specially after theAndroid 8.0 , i.e. The Oreo updateThis model has come up with so many problems1. CALL CONNECTIVITY : I ain't able to talk to someone on calls properly as it starts loosing the connectivity , or rather it'll be like , I'm able to hear the person in talking to but the person on the other side isn't able to hear anything I say ..its got so bad that every time I call someone up they hang up saying ""bro I'm not able to hear u rn , I'll call u back later .""2. HEATING ISSUES : you know what's the amazing part ..this cell phones gets heat up ...even when its not in use ""woooww!""I'm tried of this Heating issue , it gets to level where u can't , literally... hold your cell...3. HANGING ISSUES: This cell has got me so crazy coz it hangs every now and then and lags performance ..They talk abt the high end processor in this cell ..I guess its ""just on paper"" stuff , and m not even able to use two app together , like Instagram and what's app .And if I switch to musically or Snapchat , this cell just hates me then and goes black , ""i guess gotta talk to my cell abt it and settle it ! , Ryt!?""4. CAMERA : (I guess I'll end up listing all the aspects of this cell , anyway )Camera in this cell phone is GOOD , trust me on that , but it is when it wishes to be .Low light photographs are terrible.It keeps on loosing focus , every time.It sometimes doesn't even start up .. And then i have to reboot it...5. VIDEO / PICTURE QUALITY : This cell phone's video quality is too bad ...while u take it ...you'll feel it's good , but when u save it and seeIt's all noisy and full of glitches""As if I don't have sufficient net and m seeing a YouTube video on 144 or 240 pixels""6. BATTERY LIFE : ( okay I'll stop on this point , coz honestly I never wrote such big reviews )So ... Battery life of this cell is pathetic guys ,Its so bad ..that it just lasts for 2 hrs 30 mins '80%' in use ....I can't even carry it without a power bankCoz this cell looses its life so quick.On the standby mode itself .If I had an option of time and availability of cell phone (as my cell is already dead , loosing 56% of its battery in 1hr 15mins , and all I was using is a fitness app ) to attach few pictures of the section where battery usage is displayed ( I forgot what it's called ) I would've shown u the standby usage ... It's first in my ""major"" usage list using 55% of life....Battery life is the major issue I face rn , coz I don't play games and .. now I don't feel social sites that imp that they become my priority so when it gets heat up or lags / hangs I keep it aside and study or do somethin else , but calls and emergency texts or something imp need to be given priority ryt? But this cell doesn't allow me to take it as it's already displaying ""battery saver mode on""*sigh .If you'll did read this wholeeee thing , thanks Nd I'm sorry I don't have the time to write down abt the good things in this cell phone , I'm sure you'll find many other sources to find that out .FEW GOOD THINGS ARE:* If u know how to use your frnd (cell) it takes amazing pictures in day light , I love taking pictures though ..and this cell is way better than most other cell phones out there* It's performance (before the update) was amazing and smooth I was able to switch between real quick . Again. ..better than most other phones* And many other stuff ...So I rated it three coz it's eventually lacking everything , ""but I love my cell phone"" üòÇI mean .. ik this cell is really good it's just the unstable updates that have ruined it ."

0,"I bought this as I wanted to get upgraded from Mi Note 3 { my version was 3GB/32GB }This is a disappointment as I expected a robust device with Helio and 4GB RAM. I didn't liked the stock android too. May be I am used to MIUI version of android.Cons :1. Apps getting slow while using2. Stock SMS app is fail as it doesn't group #notifications like MIUI does. There is no copy OTP option.3. No screenshot button on the drag down menu from top4. Battery isn't great although I am not a gaming enthuPros:1. Only one , that's listening to music thru dolby atmos* Don't buy this if you are already using Xoami / Vivo / Oppo / CoolPad types. This is a useless piece of mobile"
0,"At first i would like to thank amazon for taling back this product. This mobile is an unmarked product with hitension issues or in other words its like expected a ton received a corn and again its not sweet corn.I would like to advise smart buyers that display over the screen and display after taking pics and videos recorded have a vast difference, as many said that amazing crystal clear display.Camera fearures have given a tight slap to buyers and video recording has smacked every ones head down. Its like recording with 2 Mp basic hand set.I wish i can put more comments, since i got my refund i am tight lipped now..Wont be trusting lenovo here after.Actually one should appreciate the video director for making all those random experiences that neither works nor responds..Regret & regards."

Google photos is very slow in copy/cut and pasting files on to memory card and is failing quite often in simple cut/ copy paste function which I am sure can be corrected in future updates.

Software has bugs, not able to recieve calls sometyms. I have to press power button twice to make screen work to recueve calls. Dual camera which lenovo says is a forte is not having enough features to even compete with other lower end single camera phones. I am trapped, not received the update yet. And amazon will not take back the product once bought until u have physical damage."

0,"I would have happily given a 4* rating had it not been for the atrocious delivery quality of Amazon.Positives:- It has a premium look and feel, and good build quality.- Setting up was easy.- Battery life is quite good, with more than 1 day for my normal usage.- Display quality is very good.- Both front and rear cameras are reasonably good for the average user. Read negatives below.- Split screen feature with two apps running at the same time is useful for people who really need it. Otherwise a novelty.- Flash can be turned on in video recording, which is another novelty with no significant improvement in video brightness except a drain on the battery.Negatives:- Lenovo claims turbo-charging, but with the standard micro-USB port and the charger provided, charging is not very fast. It took about 90 minutes to charge from 15% to full. Would hardly qualify as 'turbo'.- The Nougat OS provided is stock android with very little customisation possibilities, so may not be liked by users who are used to heavy UIs on other phones - but once you get used to it you will start accepting it.- The bokeh effect with dual rear camera is just so-so, and many times the layer separation is not as precise as you expect it to be, so you will not get desired results everytime. Also, when you turn on the dual camera, the front layer is also slightly out of focus. On the whole, you can forget that you have dual rear cameras, and stick to single camera mode for peace of mind.- Missing 'slow-motion' and 4K recording are a shame. Panorama mode does not even cover 180 degrees.Overall good value for money. Go for it if you want performance and not care for camera features."
1,Over all It's a very good device .But battery is some what
0,DO NOT buy this product. Despite of good hardware configuration this mobile fail to provide basic features. Camera do not focus on particular object after tapping. The much talked dual camera captures photo with very little blureness which looks too artificial as if edited in cheap photo editing software. Battery drains too quickly. Stock android is too much overloaded with google ads. So even if ur mobile is screen locked video and other ads keep playing and generates sound. Brightness fail to lower its intensity in dark. You can not cast the device screen on TV as it fails to detect the TV. Even from the video player you can not cast the screen. This device do not provide that feature.

1,Bought in January so writing review after 5 months... I got this phone for 11k in some offer...At this price I think it's quite worthy product.1. Camera quality is excellent but if you're comparing with DSLR or other costly phone than you may be disappointed.2. Speed is fine... Unless you don't ask for lighting speed..3. Gaming .. well I played both offline and online games it's doing pretty well.4. Speaker and sounds both are doing well till date.Cons.1. Yup battery heats sometime but that's not the phone problem as I have noticed ... It's due to network fluctuations and sometimes if you talk while charging ..So you can go for it as it's a budget phone ..I'm a moderate user of all the facilities.
0,"my honest review after using it for 6 months.1. The processor is too worst, booting of mobile takes 2-3 minutes and always shows an error message, you can't even play small games like subway surfers without struck, you can clearly see a lag in frames.2. It doesn't have Turbo Charging, it takes 1hr 20mins for a full charge. mobiles with turbo charge will take 40mins. It failed in this aspect also.3. Sometimes mobile will auto restart.4. As a usual overheating problemIn future, I won't recommend Lenovo for my friends"

0,Mainly I got this phone for it's Dolby Atmos and was curious to hear my favorite tracks. But the audio level is so damn low that even my old Moto g (1st Gen ) sounds 100 times better than this. Also battery is draining so damn badly. Camera is decent. Performance wise it's good for it's money. Also the network keeps fluctuating. Planning to return the phone if there is no update for it's volume defect.

When I came across Lenovo K8 Note, I was surprised with it's features. 4 GB RAM and 64 GB ROM was a cliche but a deca-core processor was the best thing to have in a smartphone in this price range. Overall performance is awesome."

I like it's sound quality and camera and more good features like vr spilt dislpay or dolby atom etc. But i disappointed by its heating problem some time it become very hot if we continuously use it for one hour. But battery life is good. According to me it is a good phone.

1,Truly I don't find any cons in this phone. 64gb helps a lot in installing apps which will stay in phone memory. Good ram that I can see the apps still stand even if I open it on the next day. Camera is amazing. Depth mode is good. Selfie is bad. The picture quality is not good. Very bad when front flash is on. Battery backup is very good. Turbo charging working very well.

Here comes the problem just after 10 days the low quality stuff used in this mobile like mother board and processor start troubling me like anything it used to get switch off with loud noise and disturbed display more over heating issue even my iron box doesn't heat up that much. I visited the Lenovo store near me they stated that this is happening because of new update, their version is unsatisfactory . I thought i got a faulty one but once I was in to the store then I came to know that almost 9 out of 10 are faulty one's and every customer of Lenovo(moto) mourning out in the customer care centers."

0,"Killer note, but it is only killing me. Frustrated and highly disappointed. I am writing this after 2 month usage, nothing great to tell about the phone. Just an another note serious from Lenova, the specification looks great on paper and in reality everything sucks.It gets heated up even for normal usage, the battery drains faster than normal mobiles, it is not a 4000mah battery for sure.The camera looks good not better. Don't zoom it while taking long shots. Th picture quality is not up to the mark.It does not behave like 4gb ram, it rather responds like 2gb ram and gets jammed frequently.I have installed many apps and after getting the phone slowed down, I have removed most of the aps.Guys, the price was reduced but still, you shall go for a better brands like Moto, mi, Samsung."

Any suggestions please

I used to be a huge fan of Lenovo phones,this time they have drastically embarrassed me. I spoke to Amazon rep and they checked the temperature, which was 45 degree Celsius, and per the rep it was normal. Someone tell them 45' is overheating, and the irony is you are stuck with this device, you cannot ask for refund. It's a cheating and government should do something about it. Everything is bad right from performance to camera to heating to hardware."

0,"Screen cast does not work, and when complained to lenovo, suggested to buy a chrome cast and use the screen cast, which I suggest to add a patch in android make it work directly as i was happy to use Lenovo K5 note and its screen cast.Also i do not see any significant change in 400 AH battery Vs 3500 MAH battery in K5 note. suggest for improving the same.Torch light is natural which is yellowish in nature, is the LED designed such way or is their any issue as same light appears whiter when it works as flash, while taking a photo"
1,Best phone and operating system too good
0,"Too poor camera quality as Lenovo committed that 13+5 Mp rear camera while zoom on 1x level image quality will be getting worst according to tap on little bit zoom,so poor quality as well as after taking snaps pixel quality also worst on zooming image.I ruined my 14 k bucks on this nonsense thing."

0,"Worst Product from Lenovo till date. The hand set has issues from the date of purchase. Issues faced are as under and can be an eye opener for the prospective buyers:1. Hang-up during usage - very often you are left stranded in between apps as phone hangs-up in between usage like checking whatsapp, email of sms2. Heats up excessively - The claim of fast charging is false. it takes almost 5 hours for full charge. Heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast. The battery doesn't last even 5 hours post full charge3. Battery - The claim on turbo charge is false. There is no fast charging and it takes 5-6 hours for full charge. Heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast. The battery doesn't last even 5 hours post full charge4. Access to common functions - Doesn't even have access to common functions like providing SMS service centre number. Have recently taken the handset to a lenovo service centre, even they didn't know, how to put in the sms service centre number.5. Lenovo Forum - Unlike other leading or even lesser known brands, Lenovo executives don't respond to the queries/issues put up on the forum.Over all very bad product to choose. My issue how to dispose the same.regardsCertified buyer"

1,Awesome phone...Must buy
0,I did not receive head phone in box .. headphones accessory is missing and camera clarity of this phone is pethetic
0,"The Phone display got damaged within 7 months of usage and the service center has declined the warranty stating there is an internal damage to the display. I asked them to open the phone and show the internal damage to that I can accept their statement, for which they are not ready. They say even if they open they can't show the damage. Even after escalating the issue, the issue is not resolved and they are not ready to honor the warranty. Better to go for accidental damage coverage if you are going with this phone."

0,I m not happy with lenevo not k8 I want to return this product please help Amazon
0,"Guys This phone is superior in hardware buylt its software has major shortcomings. Lenovo K3/K4 users should not buy this phone considering the performance of those phones. The software part misses some functions which makes it an below average phone for day to day use :Con's- Phone's design is rectangular so it does not fits perfectly in hand and feels heavier- No option to save contacts in phone memory , Only gmail a/c contacts support which makes contacts and call logs and messages laggy. It lags wherever you require to get contact from contacts.- Their is no option to disable vibration on call connect- Its mono loud speakers sound is loud but quality is like cheap chinese phone ,Its not like k3 - k4 notePro's- Good battery backup - 4 star for it- Screen resolution, colors & touch screen is very smooth - 5star for them- Good Processor works faster and better. But phones seems laggy due to poor hardware software coordinationI will not recomend to buy this phone, instead go for samsung phones as their software is always balanced"
1,"Nice phone , battery backup is also good as well as speaker ,but the camera is not that much better in single mode it's betterBut in duel or depth mode it's badBut the performance of the phone is outstandingNo issue with heavy gamingA good phone for gaming and soundNo issue after update"

0,"Big warning! Never ever buy this product. Amazon was great in delivering the product in great packaging and it was an original product when I bought it in Sept 17. But after using for months, I just regret buying it. Battery does not last for more than 5-6 hours, keeps on hanging and takes a lot time in saving pics. Being 64 gb and decacore, it was supposed too run smoothly, but it's a waste piece. My sony M2 phone was much better than this. Even after using for four years, runs perfectly. Never buy Lenovo phones."

1,"Good phone bad camera, great performanceI'm not one to write lengthy reviews of products, but here I felt the need to get a few points out there, because the Lenovo K8 Note isn't all that it promises to be, but it's definitely not an average product either.Point is, I bought this phone to replace my Redmi Note 3, 3GB and 32GB. I have an S7 Edge as my primary driver, I've always kept a second phone to game and watch videos. The other options I had considered were the Honor 6X and The Honor 8 Lite. The reason I went with Lenovo K8 note was for the dual camera setup and a good industry reviews on performance. It wouldn't hurt that my backup phone had a dual camera setup to play around with some bokeh fun. Here's my thoughts after using the phone as my primary phone for the past 3 days.Performance:This phone is everything that every review claims it to be. Yes it has a Mediatek processor but this deca-core setup with 4GB ram and 64Gb memory is phenomenal. In my experience, this phone handles multi-tasking as good as my S7 edge. I was playing Guns Of Boom, WWE Champions, YouTube video and Facebook all at the same time, and over a period of 45 minutes, the phone switched between these apps without a single glitch or delay. WWE Champions was open when I locked my phone. When I picked it back up afetr 20 odd minutes, I found the screen exactly where I left and it loaded the game without a seconds delay. If you want this phone for casual gaming and media, its just a pleasure to use.Camera:In all fairness, the dual camera setup on the K8 note requires a lot of polishing. Its nowhere near as good as the Honor 6X. The depth detection feature is very erratic. It works like a charm under good and day light, but try using it indoors and in the evening you'll either be left with hazy photos lacking sharpness or pictures that have been focused in the wrong areas. The front 13 MP camera is good for casual selfies though.One thing though, put the flash on and both the front and the back cameras return stellar results. The bokeh effects and the depth editor functions may not work as well as they should, but if you manage to keep a steady hand and get a good shot from the dual camera setup, then playing around with the options can be fun. Changing background and focus are fun options. (Check photos)Battery, UI, Build and valueThe battery backup is great to say the least. I tested it by playing a graphic intensive Modern Combat 5 for 2.5 hours straight and the battery dropped from 100 to 50. The casual day with some gaming, social media and calling etc takes the phone to 30-20 per cent max by 12 in the night.The phone comes with a clear / transparent plastic case installed on the phone. Since there aren't any good choices for a K8 note cover, this preinstalled one serves the purpose, but it is scratch prone. Just the second day it had dozens of scratches. (Check the photo)The all metallic build of the phone looks and feel very premium. The black colour has a nice matte finish too. But the back love fingerprints and gets a smudge very easily. (Check photo) Its best to use a black armour / cover when they become available.The best part of the K8 note is the stock android UI. That ensures the K8 note is smooth and perfectly functional. Its a snappy phone alright. The finger print sensor works like a charm on both hands, it picks up even the most obscure touches.Final Word:I would definitely recommended the k8 note. In terms of sheer performance, this phone is a pleasure. Its like a tuned up KTM engine. It may not have the most appeasing specs but the performance is all throttle and torque friendly. Sadly, the camera is below average to be frank. Either Lenovo push through some tuneups or the buyers will have to keep their photography ambitions under a strict check."

0,Not that much good as expected. Plz don't believe in reviews. Discuss with trusted earlier users before buying any product.
1,One hell of a device it is....best mid-range smartphone it is... definitely recommended

0,Your product was faulty and i asked for replace u r just engaging me in rubish things... ... . Do this then do that... ... . At last nothing happened
1,"Good phone in all respects , but slightly sluggish camera autofocus ."
1,"Really Good phone, other than the dual camera software..."
0,I am using this for quite some time now so thought of reviewing it.Everything is as per specifications given ...so I am not wasting ur time writing all those again lets gets straight to the pros and consAdv1) processor works fast so there is less chance of the pg one to get hanged2) battery backup is quite large as it has 4000mah battery3) front cam is ok4)charging is super fast I must say......but with time after a few years this speed will gradually decrease thats the problem with lenovo phones5) overall its okDisadvantages1) the back camera quality is not as it has been advertised....I would say it gives clear images ofcourse but it takes a long time to focus and adjust....I mean pretty long time to get ur perfect image which u desire2) even though it has a 4000 mah battery still I dont find any difference with the 3000/3500 mah batterys....the discharge is sameI think by now u hv got the idea that its a ok type phone not great......I am also using lenovo vibe k5 note for a year now......all the configerations r same just the battery is a 3500mah one and it has a single back camera thats it.........so I would say lenovo vibe k5 note is far better than this......atleast I felt it in these couple of months.......u can give it a try after all u always hv the option of returning on amazon.....so all the bestIf u found my review helpful dont forget to give a like ......thankssss and happy shopping
0,Is bad product net using time very high heating.
1,Excellent
1,its balanced phn in all features.the main thing is the helio x23 processor is too better than snapdragon 625 and also battery efficient.camera is giving best results. its the best choice.
0,Nice mobile bay mobile
0,"Worst experience ever with amazon bcoz of lenovo who degrade amazon valuation, gives me defective peice"
1,Good phone at the price it's being offered. Not a great camera and display but has a good ram and storage. Dedicated sd card slot is a big plus. Not many phones offer this now. Camera image quality is below average but good at this price point.Real value for money.
0,Battery performance is poor. After using 10 day it has changing problem .Takes 5 to 6 hours to full charge .
0,Very bad in catching signal...Always says out of range
0,feature is good but only one speaker worksno gallery in the phone
0,This phone worked well in India but did not work in US. ATT and Tmobile frequencies do not match. ATT is did not work at all. With Tmobile only voice works. Should not have bought this phone.
0,It's a good phone but there are some issues with the camera the camera cannot adjust the exposer so the image are more whitish and not real I hope this will be fixed via a system update but if want a perfect mobile with everything balance and your budget is 15k then u can take MI A1SUBSCRIBE MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL NAMED ASDC Technical
0,It's was great your product but now I'm to able to contact with u for my Complian GST detail update on my invoice copyI had two times contact coustermer care no one person can give positive feedback about.
0,"The mobile has some good features. But charging is very slow. (Nearly 4 hours) Initially there were problems with VOLTE (JIO) connectivity. Jio was good for internet, but calls and messaging did not work on this handset. The same jio sim worked well in another 4G handset. With software update, this issue The camera doesn't start sometimes and I had to restart the mobile. Restarting this mobile also takes a long time compared to other mobiles. Lenovo has to seriously fix these issues."
0,"My experience with this phone has been mixed. The good thing about the phone is the 1080p resolution. The videos look crisp, so you can watch youtube , netflix , prime and enjoy the visuals.The sound is not loud enough, even adding a headphone does not help much, unless it has an amplifier. You will have problems while receiving calls because the incoming volume is low. I called up the customer case and they asked me to do a factory reset. Did not help.The touch screen gets laggy after some time.I have enough spare storage and even when no apps are running, I can feel the lag. Another irritation is while holding the phone the touchscreen gets touched and results in unintentional clicks."
0,"I have purchased lennovo k8 but the mobile not switched on but heat.there is no response our complaint,custmore care is not responding.feed back immediately??????????."
1,Very good Product

0,Not Worth for Buying. Lack many Key features which was their in K5 or 6 note. Also Mobile heats like an Oven even If used for 1 hour and Battery backup is pathetic.
0,Very bad phone from Lenovo battery draining fastly and mobile heat up even of 5 min normal gaming. network never shows full and shows no signal after some time.camera deapth mode is not so good as mentioned by the lenovo.complete wastage of money
0,Worst camera quality for both front & back.
0,Not satisfied with the product. Fast charging in just 90 minutes only.
0,"Do not buy this product.In just 6 months I had to pay Rs. 2000 for servicing.Battery drains faster than it gets charged.Does not even provide adequate standby time, 20 - 25 % battery gets drained overnight and the phone just gets switched off even when no background application is running and the network is off. No auto-brightness option. 55 - 60% RAM is always occupied no matter whatever I do to clear it and the phone lags even in simple games like Subway Surfers.With all the features advertised and at this price range, it is frustrating."
1,Worth it. Aug 2017- best config on this date for this price

0,4*deducted due tovvery poor battery performance... drains in 2.5hrs... Only...
0,"Got the device yesterday.From first charge itself the charger makes loud hissing noise continuously during charging this device, but no noise while charging other devices. Similarly no noise comes when charged this device using another charger. Now I'm using the old lenovo charger instead of the new one.#2 Many software issues :Dolby atmos is not working.Clock is not getting updated while on call.Sometimes native app itself opens twice."
1,Camera result is not more expected that I thought..
0,Lenovo k8 note does not seem to support screen cast. You can cast you tube videos but you can't cast Amazon prime videos. The device or the OS seems to have a bug and does not recognize my smart TV when I try to cast. I checked online for solutions and Lenovo says to use Chromecast thus asking us to buy that indirectly. Don't buy this phone. Also it is not taking screenshot even though I tried the steps they have written. Also it doesn't recognize my ear phones which works perfectly with other Lenovo phones. Faulty device. Don't buy.

1,"Nice mobile with great performance, awesome battery backup and dash charging. The camera quality is also great only want portrait mode as it has dual camera also."
0,"5* for cameras, the cameras are really good the pictures are clear and perfect. Front camera with flash is really a good thing. The depth mode wasn't working perfectly, but after few updates it was rectified.1* for its turbo charging, it takes 2.5 hrs to charge it's battety from 30-100.1* for its volte, does not support jio voice calls. After 2 calls volte wont work.5* for its dolby, it has a very good quality of sound but volume can be improved.4* for its fully metallic body, its quite heavy but good slim attractive look3* for its battery, because for this smartphone 4000mAh is not sufficient.5* for its fingerprint sensor, it is quick in recognising the finger imprints.3* for its processors, processors are good but it takes a little bit of time to load some applications.The main thing which really disappointed me was-does not support Volte(it's 4g volte isn't permanent it's switches on and off whenever the phone wishes. If volte goes off you should restart your phone, again after placing two calls you must again restart to continue voice calls through Volte that is through jio Sim.)-turbocharging does not work, it takes more time to charge.(if you plug in your phone at 30%, to reach 100% it takes at least two hours.)"

Its 1 month since i bought the phone and the screen cracked when the phone fell from just the dining table.Not happy with the phone.Fake Gorilla Glass. Highly recommended to NOT BUY the phone....
1,Best phone in sub 15 k category
1,Good product.everything is perfect in this phone when compared with its price.
0,"It,s nice one.but software futures need to add more options."
0,Have been using K4 Note for over an year & half. Very satisfied with that. K8 with Nougat OS is marginally better on overall performance but seriously low on user customization. Audio level of speaker and Headphone a big letdown.
1,Awesome
0,"Stay away from this phone, signal quality is not just bad - it is a fail; k-series finally has brought in the disease that finished Motorola; k8 Note says on the back that it is made by Moto Mobility. I have had 3 k3 notes, 2 k4 notes & 1 k5 note; all good phones; k4 note is an excellent phone. this k8 note is crap; i will have to throw it away. It is completely unpredictable with signal reception; strong 3g signal with no data; strong 4g signal and then another minute zero signal; strong signal but bad call quality; i can go on & on; it is a very inconvenient user experience. So k-series legacy has been done with Motorola's legacy of oblivion."

One goes battery failed, second phone‚Äôs Speaker failed, third phone sensor stopped to work, and forth one mic problem. This is first time When I took decision to go out from Apple Samsung and HTC but now seems It was very bad idea to choose other from them. Lenovo failing to provide good device as well service too. They don‚Äôt keep any hardware device in advance. They always order new for new complain and give time line upto 3 days but they won‚Äôt give you in three days. It will take almost one and half week to resolve issue. They don‚Äôt have good product and good service."

0,"My 1st Lenovo mobile let me down with the worst performance. After a long while, I bought this Lenovo k8 note which is also let me down again.1) Deca core processor, but still lags, not fast enough.2) Getting heated up like Iron box while charging. I think one can iron their clothes with this mobile.3) Lenovo still a plenty of work to do to make their mobile phones work better. Even, their Chinese counter parts - Honor & Xiaomi are doing great from their failures/set backs. Lenovo yet to learn that. This mobile has got very good spec., But it's software is not optimised for better performance. As usual, Lenovo lost its basics.4) 4000mAH battery, but it doesn't last for a day after the update (Not Oreo update)There are many issues with this Lenovo mobile. So, as others said, DON'T BUY IT BY SEEING THE SPEC. If you do so, you'll be one among us to worry about your decision about buying this mobile. üëéüòïüôÅüòèüòì"

Specially Anna Salai HCL touch centre no response when u call them on phone numbers.Don't buy Lenovo brand. Amazon we have good faith non I don't all bad brand.
0,Why to buy a 4GB RAM phone when the high quality games do not run to the utmost. 4000mAH battery to die everytime you play games and when your internet is on. It gets warmer. The camera quality is good. But I will not recommend this phone to anyone.

0,"Not much good, I'm using about 1 year. Performance is ok, but facing so many problems, if we use camera frequently it will stop working. If phone restarted it wil work. Network issue is the major one. Every time it says out of coverage area, we can see the coverage about 30 %. But cant access the internet and couldn't make a call. It will drop automatically, i changed sim. Both sim having same problem. So confirmed phone problem. They says this is stock android and we got android update first. We all know new phones are available in market with android oreo os. Our stock android lenovo phone still works with noughgat, no update providing, depth mode is fully waste. The photo looks like we edited in 3rd party application. No originality when we take depth enabled picture. They says an option that we can clear the background color as black and white. Its lie. It has no option for changing background color."

0,"The phone start responding to random touches without even touching it.And it started happening within 5 minutes of starting to use.The return/replace requests on app/site are of no use.The chat with customer care wasted much time only to be told that i need to call.When called, it again wasted time and then i was connected to phone department.They listened to problem and and put me on hold for 15 minutes.They must be thinking i will disconnecting but i didn't.Anyways after the call resumed, i was told that there is no issue with the phone. They have verified it with EMEI no. Now this is insane.So the next step would be to search for a service centre and get a certificate from them that the phone is defective and then only it can be returned/replaced. All this within 10 days.So much for the famed Amazon Prime service.Its better to visit hot-spot and buy a phone from there. Their service is just amazing."

0,"Lenovo is 0 at customer satisfaction. This phone is piece of s*#*#t. Really battery draining like hell. Jio sim won't work it shows full strength but when anybody tried to call u will get out of coverage notification sms sent is failing always. And there is no way to give them suggestions and support is worst. This is really true they even don't have knowledge of what products they are selling. And gaming console support is not there I was trying to pull request for that nobody is there to listen. Heating issue is too much. Please don't buy this phones instead of wasting your hard earned money on this, donate it to poor....."

0,"Hello,The phone starts resetting itself randomly. This issue starts after after 3 days of use, especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two. The issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days, then I tried few option mentioned in Lenovo help APP which is pre-installed(I am feeling like a stupid for having done this) , after that for 4 or 5 days it didn't show this issue. Now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night. Use the phone in night, then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning, boom, it is dead already. And when you manually power-on there is enough juice left in the battery. Not sure what to do with this kind of issue, the phone is absolutely useless.When I approached amazon for return, they are quoting policy and suggest me that I should run pillar to post to get problem rectified (not sure even it is rectifiable issue), The below Amazon's tagline tag-line sounds funny"" Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company."", I am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean, I am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in Amazon and now I realized that buying Lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage."

0,"Turbo charging stopped working with the in - box charger 10days after buying..First gave 4 stars to this,but now i would have given 0 star if it existed..I wouldn't have bought the phone if it wasn't for turbo charger..Not only this,there are still many cons..like CAST option doesn't work ..But this is a major problem..And the service is worst..The charger didn't work for the second time and the service centre wierdos lied that the warranty period for the charger is over and asked to pay RS 1500/- for the new one..and know what..? The charger still has 6 months warranty left..!! Selling phones by making false statements..LENOVO sucks.."
0,"I bought this phone with lot of hopes going by the specs described. However, it was a huge disappointment..BIG MISTAKE!. The phone is absolutely rubbish..Blue tooth was not working, Volume and sound output was very poor (considering that lenovo claims those are Dolby stereo), camera was not up-to the mark, display was not abysmal, Colour display was nothing to write home about..All in all it is one HELLUVA DISASTER OF A PHONE...In summary PLEASE DONT BUY..ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY..i wouldnt pay even 5000K for this!"

I was initiallyvery excited about this mobile but i found it over rated now..Moreover, I guess with the passage of time unfortunately the quality of goods at Amazon is deteriorating day by day.

0,"Writing this review after using this mobile for one week.Fast delivery by Amazon and packaging is good.Phone is some what heavy, but still manageable. When i switched on internet it asked for some system updates, before those updates i didn't face much issue with the mobile, but after that update if u charged ur mobile once it reached 100% automatically phone will be switched off. So we can't charge it in the night and have to unplug it before it's reaching 100%.Battery backup is ok. Will last for one day if you didn't play much games. You can't cover the screen entirely by using tempered glass, because of edge design. Charging is taking much time eventhough it's saying it has quick charge option. Earphone is missing in the box. Camera clarity is average. They have opted so many Moto technologies, but still needs to improve a lot.Android 8.0 update will be received on July as per Lenovo. I believe with in that they will launch the next version."

0,"Updated review:I had used Redmi 4A before & never had any network issue with Vodafone. But with this phone., I;m constantly switching from 3G to $g to 3G depending on the area.Battery is draining fast unless you charge it to full for over 3 hrs.Can someone recommend where to buy the orginal fast charger for this? Mine got damaged in the rain.So i have only been using it for less than 24hrs, but here's what all i discovered:-Cons1. Heating issue exists. While i spent time trying to figure out this depth mode, my cam was on for around 15 -20 min with wifi running in the background. The phone started getting warmer in my hand to the point that you could just almost be uncomfortable.2. Slippery back cover-although the phone comes with a transparent hard back cover, it's still a bit slippery. The original cover is like a magnet for patches & sweaty hands do no good to it.3. Battery-when i unboxed the phone(around 6pm) it had some 46% charge already which however lasted only until 12am, 6hours with no gaming or media usage. Surprisingly when the battery alarm went off at 15%, it lasted for just 10 min before shutting down. If 15% charge with low battery mode activated gives me just 10 min, thats really pathetic I'd say. With my Redmi 4A, i used to survive at least an hour with 15% charge. Very disappointed.4. Network issues. I used Vodafone 4G. While mobile data lacked any disruptions in connection, what I found is low voice quality. Even in open spaces, there was loss of voice & the bars for network weren't full.Pros-1. The Dolby Atomos speakers -4/5 would need to figure out how to control the bass etc. Speakers are quite loud though, haven't yet checked with the ringer volume when phone is in pocket.2. Front cam-again excellent. I especially love the flash, which does't give you an ashen look, but colour stays vibrant.3. Depth mode- the bokeh mode does take about 10-15 min of practice to figure out. The after effects like removing background & selective monochrome are great.4. No lags yet. I'm yet to install any games, but after opening around 5-6 social media apps , te phone didn't show any lags.5. Display with the adaptive brightness on is a treat. No more squinting in the sun to make out whats on the screen. Also when i played videos, the clarity was brilliant. Can't wait to try the VR mode.6. Split screen feature is quite convenient, I used with Whatsapp & Chrome.Will update more after a few days of use, especially about the battery which is the main reason i bought this phone"
1,Very good
0,I have purchased this product before 2 weeks.üîàSpeaker performance is 0 out of 5 as compared to k4 noteIt is quiet disapoainted me that it doesn't support dolby atmos .But company is saying it is dolby atmos.Camera is out of focus.totaly worst as compared to other dual cam phones.Battery back up is 1 day.Only plus is heavy speed in browsing and.hd pictures .screen quality is average.1 out of 5üò¢üò¢üò¢Do not buy this model.better u go for k4 or k3

0,"This product not good,why means over heting.I want another company phone?"
0,Dont buy this product
0,"I don't know why some people have given 5 or 4 star rating to this crap. This phone has serious issues regarding everything. The dual camera setup is something like 'jugaad' of DSLR quality photography. I didn't find any serious performance issues as it is Mediatek,not SnapDragon. I expect nothing great from Mediatek. The biggest drawback is the screen quality. I was watching a video on youtube, suddenly I thought I should increase the resolution to check the quality of screen. Dude,it was already playing on 1080p! Screen just doesn't feels like Full HD i.e. 1080p not even close to 720p. Dolby Audio is nothing but just a fake software. VR works like charm. Fingerprint is good, responsive. Didn't find issues with call quality or WiFi reception. Build quality is strictly average due to just fine metallic body. Phone will get heated up if you play games or watch video. Backlit Navigation Bar is not there,that means during night,you will probably end us guessing the navs. Front camera is again ok,selfie flash just another light feature on image. Turbo Charging is again not so impressive. Earphone jack is not of standard size or configuration as ejecting or inserting is little hard. Overall average phone,I am waiting for the customer care call to return this phone. Hugely Disappointed!"

Good android software. Panels should have been backlit, you have to search them in dark üòû, 7/10."
1,It's nice smartphone. Smart features and awesome to uses. The camera quality is nice. Mostly battery backup is fantastic. You must purchase from Amazon. Amazon give very cheap price.

0,"The phone loses the signal even though it shows full strength. I keep receiving missed call notifications. Seems like hundreds of people have confirmed this model's signal issues. One Amazon exec. promised a reimbursement but the systems were not working for a few days. When I called back after some time they said they can't reimburse, only replace the same model. The model is faulty and I don't want it. Don't know what to do. I'm willing to buy a more expensive phone from Amazon, but they're throwing a policy which isn't mentioned when u buy. Sad and frustrated."

1,Amazing product at this price. I really loved it.
0,"Hi All , I am writing this review after a long time as I realised that people are missing noticing one big disadvantage of this phone.I ordered this phone on the first day of it's sale. I got it in two days. The day I got it I noticed that while you connect your phone to the charging and at the same time you keep operating the phone like watching youtube videos or surfing the Facebook or wats app then it stops charging . I mean its battery percentage does not increases or it increases by 1% in 10 mins or so.The second thing I noticed is when you connect the phone through data cable to laptop or cpu then also it does not charges or charges with very slow rate like the one I mentioned above.I then asked for replacement as I thought there might be some defect in my set.However, even the set I got after replacement had the same issue. Finally I had to go for the return and refund.I think this is a manufacturing defect which exists in all Lenovo k8 note sets.I therefore advise everyone to check this issue in their set and if it's not a major concern for you then all other aspects of the mobile are great.I hope this helps. :)"

0,"I bought Lenovo k8 note to myself 2 weeks ago and I can say this without any doubt that it is the best phone in the price range of 12000 to 15000 rupees. I am so much satisfied with the performance of the phone in every aspect. The performance has been very good. The best thing about the phone is its camera function and the quality of screen along with dolby atmos surround sound.The look and design of the phone is however little average in comparison to other phones of sam price range. The look and design is very outdated. But it still seems decent.The biggest USP of the phone has been its features. It has 3GB Ram with 32GB internal memory. It has a dolby atmos surround sound with 3.5 mm jack. The screen quality is also very good. It is available for a price of rupees 13000. The model with 4 GB RAM and 64GB internal memory is available for 14000 rupees.The sound quality has been excellent. In fact, Lenovo provides best sound quality in comparison to other phones.The phone give the feeling of a good value phone with some great features and nice looking body.It is a very user-friendly phone according to me.I would definitely recommend this phone everyone who are in search of a very good phone with great features in the price range of under 15000 rupees. I will rate this phone 4.5 out of 5 stars.It is definitely worth the value for money."

And now with in 1 month the price of this phone decreased by ‚Çπ1000. Which was very disappointing for me because I was one of the customers who showed interest in your product but after sometime you decreased the price. it seems like you don't give importance to the customers who have faith on you. I hope you got my point and explain me the reason behind this. And also come with a solution of this problem.As well as it's having scratch on its screen, since it is gorilla glass, not expected so early ..Thankyou "
0,Dust can get in camera easily... Lenovo should do proper camera packing in handset
0,"The phone is very good in terms of Hardware and configuration, however, that on Software part I didn't find Andoird Nougat that good. It is lacking many features which its prior version Lenovo K4 Note was having.Many essential features like Gallery, Phone Recording etc. are missing. Also, the screen has curved edges so I am not able to find a proper tempered glass till date. This phone is actually a Motorola selling under the brand of Lenovo. Lenovo product K4 Note was much better."

0,"Very poor quality of charger(Turbo charger). Stopped working within one month of regular use. As directed by Amazon we approached Lenovo for replacement. Though under warranty, their service centre is unwilling to replace it with a new one by giving various excuses like insisting for phone also to be returned back along with the charger. The phone is working fine only adopter needs to be replaced, then why are they insisting for phone I don't understand. With normal charger it takes ages to fully charge."

With a microphone problem, I got it replaced. But I am not satisfied with the Options in the phone, viz. No Screen shot facility, No cast screen, camera lighting is not good, no call recording, no gallery which is a default in all other phones. if these options are reviewed and updated by Lenevo group, this phone is best. Or otherwise I may be grateful if my phone is exchanged. I bought this through Amazon. I am still having my Lenevo A 7000, I am thinking to use that as if this is not updated with the above options. Hope Lenevo will look after this to have more buyers in future as I think Lenevo is good in it's price and performance."

0,"Don't waste money buying this, Lenovo K8 Note 13 mpxl camera doesn't even give you Redmi 5 mpxl camera quality and night photos are really bad. Heating is another issue, when you play games or record a video it gets heat. Also the battery is not that great, turbo charging takes about 1.5hrs to charge and it drains fast. My suggestion go for other brands which has a Sony low light enhancer (sensor) if you are looking for a camera phone.And this product you cant return and you have to go with it once you buy it. Think before you buy."

0,"Worst experience, I purchased Lenovo K8 note in the first flash sale from Amazon.in. I was very excited to catch the phone that's why I ordered the phone with ""Fast delivery option"" but when received, it was worst experience. its name is KILLER NOTE just because it will kill your expectations, excitement.I did compare charging with my another phone, charge percentage and duration were similar on both phones.1. Phone heats badly during charging, browsing etc. 43-degree Celsius temperature is dangerous. The device can be blast.2. Corning gorilla glass!!!!! Noticeable major scratches on the display within a week while I am a very light user.3. No nano coating. Finger's stains visible on the screen.4. Turbo charging does not work."

0,"I would rate it 2 star, being at price of 14000, it doesn't have gallery and music app which we need to search from play store and even though after installing several apps, I am not satisfied with the 3rd party apps as compared to by default manufacturer.Also, it comes with fast charging mode but taking 8 hour to charge from it's 15watt adapter.In 14000, there are so many options available and which are far better than this, best is go with Redmi....."

1,"Good , no heating , good performance, good camera. sound quality compare to K6 is not good , waiting for software fix from Lenovo"
1,The product is good build study in hand and feels good but due to mediatek the ideal battery drain is high the 40000 mAh battery should give at lest 1& half day of battery life but that's not the case it's just good for one day of use with moderate usage .... Overall the phone is powefull and a good overall package
0,The screen glass not as tough ... I use an IPhone and an K4 note on android befor this K8 and this one got two deep gashes on screen with normal usage of keeping it in the pocket .. K4 screen was much durable than this ... u better buy a screen guard along with this phone ... it take longer to access files and photos when u put in 128gb card .. also startup time lags after u download a few apps etc ... not worth K8 should increase quality than K4 but in this phone it's reverse ... looking forward to my experience at service centre will post it later
0,Dont waste ur money by buying this crap...u may focus on the cost and feautres and get easily jealous to get this phone...u will regret as i did...one of the worst phn..already i have retuned the same as per amazonpolicy..defect in battery.charging and heating issues...the saddest part is im getting a new same handset again

0,Everything is good except battery backup..only 1day battery backup...
0,Well i m writing this review after using this phone for 5 days. Well this phone is not my first choice i want to buy redmi note 5 pro but flash sale goes out of stock in blink of eye so i ordered this device. What i have concluded after using this-1.No lagging issue.2.No heating issue.3.Battery backup is good but not as good like redmi note 4 which have the same size battery 4100 mah.4.Camera is average if u guyz looking for depth mode or bokeh effect in this device then u feel disappointed because the image taken in depth mode is poor. It hardly recognize the subject and it sometimes blur the edges of subject. While the mi a1 and mi note 5 pro gave the best portrait mode and bokeh effect in the same price category.5.Front camera is 13 megapixels but the image taken look like just 5 megapixels camera have taken it. It have no sharpness and clear picture like 13 megapixels phone.6.If u like listening songs and watching movies then u have the benefits of dolby atmos sound system which gave good quality bass in the headphones. Dolby atmos equalizer provide the true sound and bottom speaker is also good with clear voice.7.Turbo charger is the only name thing it took almost 2 hours to fully charge the phone.Overall i got this phone in 11k price which i found good to buy this device but if u are looking for camera than go for mi a1 or note 5 pro which is only 2k or 3k costlier than this phone but u have to go through the flash sale which again disappointment by redmi.I only got this device because it have dual sim + memory card system and dolby atmos support and it is cheaper than other phones with same features.I hope u found this review helpful.

1,Honest review.its a good phone deserves a 4 star specially buying it with exchange offers makes it damn worry of price.built is a bit average.camera quality is lot better and functioning is smooth.lenovo offering stock Android is what it made me buy this phone.Overall it's a worth to buy phone.
0,"Everything about the phone is horrible - battery life, speed, problem in restarting & wifi connection, lack of depth effect in camera pictures (dual camera is for namesake only).I think I have been given a defective piece in the flash sale. The return window is showing closed now. Really want to know how I can return this handset and get rid of this painfully slow phone."

0,"Without data being ON, battery is fantastic. This is the only reason why I purchased this. Next are 4, 64 and CG glass. Touch screen is super sensitive. Right now I am using a single sim. with a double sim battery backup needs to be checked.Not recommended for those who look for a good camera, and feature rich phone. Camera colour reproduction is really poor indoors. Recommended redmi note 4 over this. I am unable to add a contact in sms without converting it into mms. Can be done in Moto g series."

0,"Do you know, the amazon.in exchange value for this mobile bought 4 months before from amazon.in is 1603/- MRP 13999/-DON'T WORRY LENOVO, I'LL AWARD YOU THE WORST OF ALL 2017 AWARD FOR YOUR KG KNOWLEDGE INNOVATION, EVEN THAT FAILED.This is to Lenovo & Team, may the rest to know about Lenovo.This is my ever first product of Lenovo bought on the very first sale, I regret for that and this is my last product of Lenovo.The device has decta core (10) but performance wise it's quad core, may be less but sure not more.It has software issues, frequently shows crash error which irritates users to the peak. ""Process system isn't responding""Bluetooth distracts, many have raised this issue in Lenovo forum but nothing useful from Lenovo & Team ( better concentrate your engineering team before releasing every product), Users are not your beta testers. One user provided the solution which seems to be work good but nothing by lenovo ( your service & quality proves here ).Wifi Hotspot the most hot issue raised by several users in the forum but the reply from Lenovo says out team couldn't duplicate the issue please do post us the info. Even when millions of data given nothing is going to happen. One user gave the solution which isn't applicable to all.Camera updates isn't good, too bad. Worthless to have these much of MegaPixels as hardware alone.BETTER REVIEW YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE RELEASING IN TO THE MARKET, HATE LENOVO.I definitely swear not to recommend your product anytime."

The phone worked well initially, however, the heating issue started to show early and kept worsening with every day use. Further after updating to Android Oreo, now phone gets heated insanely after few minutes of use. Also battery gets drained quite frequently. Don't waste your precious money on this piece of shit."

0,"Have been using the Lenovo K8 note now for over 4 months, overall its a good phone but it was very disappointing to find out that the cast screen option doesn't work. Camera is decent. Can play heavy games without any lag. Has basic heating issues that every phone has, nothing major though. Could overlook the heating issue for that matter. 3 android updates received since I bought it but still didn't have any fixes for the cast screen."
0,"Loving stock Android. After 3 months of use, after paying 14k for this phone, I would say don't buy it. Camera has worst quality in this price range. When you view photos taken from this camera on computer then you will understand. Also no inbuilt gallery app. Google photos compresses photos reducing quality. Battery backup reduced after latest update.No 4k video recording."

1,Excellent
0,The battery back up will make you cry. A deca-core processor not supported by battery back is just not acceptable. it does not last even half a day. The ultra fast charging is a hoax. it does not charge from 15% to 100% in anything less than 6-7 hours.
1,Good phone but one problem no gallery
1,5 star means 5 out of five...
0,i would give less than one star for this phone. Very bad signal receiving capacity. after purchasing this phone i have a smart phone with no proper internet connectivity. jio signal and internet works perfectly fine with my wife Moto g4 phone. this really sucks.I would strongly recommend not to go for it.
1,Hey.. I also bought this phone & after 3 days of usage.. I think the phone is good. The rear camera is not too good bt the front cam is awesome. Battery backup is superb. Stock rom is really very good. Overall the phone is good in this price segment. As compare to other one's.!!

1,"The phone is quite stylish and its performance is up to notch in the category. The battery is also powerful and can withstand 1 and half days after fully charged. Though turbocharging is provided you will hardly notice fast charging.Though mine can charge up to 65-70% from 0% in one hour. The only problem, I am experiencing is that it does not show hotspot notifications or either detail about connected devices. Also there is no support provided by Lenovo as i search for it."

1,Nice phone been using it for approximately a month. Fun to use.
0,"PLEASE READ THIS GUYSListen, I bought K8 note few days ago, and i have to return the device. Don't get me wrong I love lenovo devices , previously i was using k3 note(it was ok-ish), but i had to return k8 note bcz of some unusual problems.1.) Though it says it has VOLTE support, maybe it doesn't and again, maybe my device was faulty. On mobile network it only shows LTE (no volte) and with the battery saver on u'll miss incoming calls and can't even make an outgoing call(moto e4 plus also has the same problem and other lenovo devices).2.) Secondly, it tends to unlock the camera interface while shooting a video, so u can't tap to focus. I don't know everytime i was shooting a video, it locks the whole interface, and then i had to double click and unlock it again(whole lotta work..believe me) irritating af..3.) While using jio beside the fact i wasn't able to make or receive a call with battery saver on. With normal mode it was great. Problem started when i started using my secondary Aircel SIM. after few hours the phone simply dosent detect the sim, AT first i thought theres a fault in my sim, but then i used vodafone, airtel..same stuff happened.Lenovo k8 note is a great device no doubt..very fast..impressive camera..average battery..but not at all optimized properly.I wish lenovo gives an ota update to fix the errors asap"

1,Cast screen not working....
0,I purchased it on 17th October 2017 and it is delivered today i.e on 20th October. I was using K3 Note earlier. its started hanging. at first I thought not to go for Lenovo but specifications temted me again to go for K8 Note. It is my strong suggestion never (I repeat never) go for Lenovo.In K8 Note even some very basic utilities are missing. Primarily noted deficiencies are.....1. Call Recording facility not Available.2. Photo Gallery not Available. Photos open in Google Photo. Not much secure as those are online.3. Home page is very disappointing. Not much flexibility available.4. There are very less options available in settings.5. LED Flash light is yellowish (warm white) in place of milky white (Cool daylight). It appears like bulb light.6. Rapid Charging not working. It's charging like normal charger.7. Meeting/Silent mode button is no where available. Its important while attending meeting/conferences.A big NOOOO for K8 Note.
1,Nice handset....

0,Quality not best
1,Good phone with extraordinary features in budget range
0,"The mobile overall is ok due to higher specifications such RAM 4 GB, Internal memory 64 GB and provision for memory card and some other features, but lacks few important features that other models K4 & K5 notes have. K8 does not have Power Saver setting which greatly helps to save battery power when Data connection is not required. It also does not have Scheduled power on and off setting which also very useful to save battery power. On account of this the battery runs down very quickly' Sound reproduction in K5 note is much better than in K8. Also miss-calls and new SMS are not shown on the screen icons but one has to specially click on the icons to check. Difficult to know why Lenovo K8 manufacturers overlooked this important features. Also photos and videos cannot to be accessed directly from the camera screen but one has to access from the gallery or file manager."
0,Not satisfied with the camera and overall experience.
0,Cast screen is not being done with my smart TV like Lenovo k3 Note without help of Google chromecast. Issue this problem. This is cheating in higher version set Lenovo k8 Note.

0,"Lenovo is known for cheap and feature rich phone. Lenovo note is its one of the most popular phone lineup. Let's see what phone has to offer in therms of quality and performance and what are its shortcomings.ProsIt is dual sim volte 4g phone which means it will work with almost every telecom service provider.Full Metal body. In this price range very few brands are offering full metal body.Comes in two variants 3GB of RAM and 32GB 4GB RAM and 64GB GB. Both variants has enough ram and storage space. 4GB version offers best value for money.Note K8 note is using Mediatake Hellios x23 Deca Core Soc Processor this processor is very capable and its performance rivals with Snapdragon Soc.It is one the cheapest phone with dual camera with phase detect. The primary sensor is 13mp while secondary is 5mp. The camera is coupled with fast lens.Front camera is 13 mp With moderately fast lens. Both front camera and back camera has flash and they both perform well. Video and photo has enough details.Just like previous models, K8 note also has standard 5.5 inch full hd display. Screen is bright and has ample contrast.Now K8 note is using latest stock android. Stock android tends to be more responsive than modified version and has less bloatware.It has 4,000mAh battery with turbo charge support.It is water resistant.For music lovers it have dedicated music key.Audio is very clean and Supports dolby sound enhancement.Has home button and back button.Supports wifi ac band.It has dedicated card slot.Support USB On Go.Cons:-Comes without earphones.Sim and SD Insert and Remove Mechanism Needs a pin to insert or remove sim or sd card.No NFC present.No infrared support.Slow camera lens which leads to bad low light performance.Does not have either usb 3.0 or usb c.Even though processor itself support 4k video recording phone does not support it.Does not have enough service center. Service after sales is not adequate.Battery performance and usages average, will depend on usages pattern and apps used:-Charging time approximately 2 hours with stock charger.Web Browsing wifi and mobile data 10 hours.Only calling nothing else 20 hours.Video Playback 14 Hrs.Verdict.K8 note is a feature rich phone which follows the foot print of older device. It would be perfect device it it had 4K and dust resistant support. Nonetheless it is very competitive decide and I do recommend this phone as this phone has almost everything which will sufficient for most users.I hope that my review helped you. If you have any other question fell free to comment below or message me directly. I will be glad to assist you and answer all your queries."

0,"Reviving again: This phone has network connectivity issue and Bluetooth issue. ALL These days I was wondering on network and after changing sim to other phone found out issue with Lenovo itself.Previous Review:Looks good with one day use as of now. Fully charged mobile will give you 24 hours battery backup with average usage.Design is nice, Lenovo could have reduced the bottom and top space given for camera and menu buttons. Other wise it is nice, fingerprint button is at the right place for handy usage.I am adding to my previous comments - If you are looking for a great camera this is not for you! Camera is not at all of good quality picture. Minor heating problem is there while used continuously or during continuous gaming. Charge back up is still good."

0,"I bought this phone from Amazon last week. I am not a mobile phone gamer and just need the phone for normal stuff like music, emails etc. I wont review the other aspects but just want to make you aware about one particular issue that I am facing with this phone.The bluetooth on this phone does not work. It keeps disconnecting from the devices it is connected to. I have tried it with my car audio as well as Jabra conference call speakers that I have. All my other phones work with them with 0 issues. This phone just doesnt work. It keeps disconnecting and reconnecting every 45 seconds or so. Its really annoying and makes the phone virtually useless for me. I am forced to keep another phone in my car now and I am forced to use that phone for conference calls. Why did I buy this phone, I wonder. I can understand a unit being defective, but Amazon is not taking it back for an exchange. When I go to return link, it just installs a fraud perfomance measurement app which tells me that everything is fine with the phone.Hey Amazon, I wont become poor if you dont replace this phone, but please know that I will never again buy high value items from this site ever again if you dont get your act together and provide me with an exchange at least."

0,Lenovo phone after sales service is pathetic and quality of phone motherboards is very very cheap. My previous model of killer note series went dead just after more than a year. Having spent close to 14 k one would at least expect 2/3 years lifespan. In the long run these phones may not be worth the money you spent.

1,Nice mobile in this price
0,"After using the phone for approx. 15 days i am writing this review. My first opition abt the mobile is it is half cooked product with lots of issues.1) Battery drain very fast and you will never get the feeling that the mobile have a 4000 mah battery. Infact if you are heavy gamer or music lover than never forget to keep the powerbank with yourself.2) If you are using the JIO sim than this mobile is not for you. Because if you left the phone idle for more than 5 mints than the caller will get the message than the ""no is either switched off or outof coverage area"". For the other operator also network reception is very bad. And this is generalised problem. Lenovo forum is already flooded with this problem and user from all over india is facing this issue.3) camera is good if you give some time.And more issues like battery drainage, slow charging etc.In my opinion dont go with mobile.There are lots of other options available with the better configuration in the same price range."

1,Satisfied with the price n quality.true comparison with honor 6x.its better than it.i hd used both.bokeh mode is super better then 6x.
0,"Phone seems to work very fast, the GUI also seems to very good. Something wrong with the battery drain issues, idle time only takes a lot on battery drain, though with 4000 Mah, phone needs to be charged twice. Charging also takes a lot of time. Maybe the further software updates might fix these issues, but still these teething issues is not giving me confidence to keep this phone for long. Camera is not clicking good photos during sunlight. Lenovo pick up your socks on software updates"

Even it won't charge fully even after more than 10hours of charging. Camera quality is not at all good. Very blurry pictures. Waste of moneyDon't buy it. Never buy it. Don't waste your money.

Battery even in standby mode without data on, only 10 calls are getting exhausted, need to on the battery booster, it's really pathetic after doing rigorous market research end up buying a good phone with battery having worst life ever.Reason being given five star, wanted to noticed who has decided to buy this phone and reading good reviews with good rating. Pls do not buy, although it is cheaper than industry standard, but even 1000 rs don't want to spend if it is not value for money"

No heating in general use. However, if you open some heavy apps you might see some warmth.3. The front camera is world class, while the rear camera isn't upto my expectation to be honest.So all in all a great phone, every phone would have some cons and same is for this as well. But 4 stars are quite apt."

0,"Hi all,As Lenovo launched this phone as KILLER NOTE, it is honestly a killer one. Today, I'm posting my reviews. I'm using this phone from last one week. There are some pros and some cons too..Good ones :-Deca core processor,Slim and sleek design,Powerful and quick response,Lighting fast fingerprint sensor,Feather touch,Brighter display,Feels classy,Brilliant front camera,No heating problem,No lagging or hang problem...Areas of disappointment :-1. Rear Camera - It was not as good as to be. There is some lack of stability and photo quality is not up to the mark.2. Battery life - Though it is 4000 mAh but it didn't last for a day. As this is my new phone but battery drains within a day.3. Screen Quality - Previously I was using SAMSUNG NOTE 3, so might be a bit biased but as per K8's screen resolution, this problem should not come. Thought screen is bright enough but it shows some unexpected errors or lack of smoothness was observed while playing videos.4. Earphones - this is a very awkward. Cheap cost cutting techniques. I was very surprised when I didn't found earphone in the box. This is really unexpected. So that I REMOVE ONE STAR out of five.5. Packing Quality - packing quality from AMAZON was very poor. Phone was packed in just a piece of cardboard only. No bubblesheet, No protection against water damage, handling damage.So that, 3 Out of 5 stars.This is all,But I must say if you want a powerful and stylish phone within the budget, you must go for it."

1,Excellent
0,This is worst phone do not buy this phone.. Both Amazon and Lenovo is cheating with us. Each and every feature is worst..
0,"Please read the full review here.This phone is one big mess, it hardly manages 6 HOURS of screen on time.Forget about lasting a full day.I got a maximum of 6 hours of SOT and a minimum of 4 hours 30 minutes on a single charge.I'm a light to medium user.I use 3G with 2 hours of mobile data and 4-5 hours of wifi.If you are thinking you can make a day with the phone you are wrong.Please do not make this mistake and don't go for positive reviews. If the phone has been really positive it had a score of 4 or more, and not many people have reviewed this phone.The camera quality is ok ok, with the depth effect still to be enhanced.Performance is awesome but battery life really killed the phone. 4000 mAH battery doesn't seem to help at all.Redmi note 4 gives better battery performance of 8 to 9 hours of SOT with exactly similar performance.I don't think you should expect software updates and hope things will get better in the future, that is how Lenovo works.Release stupid phone and make money from stupid peoples like us.But if you still wanna buy God Help you."

Photo and video quality is very bad in mobile.There is no use of camera in mobile.Sound quality is also not good compare other mobile. it sound like china and cheap mobile.Memory,Processor and Ram are only good feature in phone.My advice is not to buy this phone. it is worth spend money on this mobile."

Haven't done extreme gaming but otherwise it exceeds expectations for business/personal functions.Untweaked android allows you to customise apps that you are already used to.. Sound quality is by far the best in similarly priced phones.Only con for me right now is the longish boot time .All in all, highly recommend."

They boast in their launch event that its a ""Theatre Max"". They didnt even properly checked whether the VR basic videos can be played in it. What a disgrace. The images are out of sync and shows as 2 images during watching. The sound effect is pretty good and performance and battery is good. But, The VR and Cast bugs are the worst possible reasons to hate it."

0,"Revising my earlier review written about 4 months ago in which I gave 5 stars.The biggest problem is battery, which is getting worse with each system update. Its 4000 mah battery is worse than a contemporary similar phone with 3000 mah battery. Something seriously wrong and the irony is no serious effort by Lenovo to rectify it. Barely after 4 months of the purchase, I have to recharge the phone twice every day. It now seems the problem is beyond redemption.Secondly, I am not able to send the image from Photos to a folder (on selecting the image), without being online."

Depth mode (dual cam) is not working properly5. Hotspot is not working6. This time amazon is pathetic, not at all helpful. YOU CAN NOT return the product. First you need to speak to technician about you phone and then they will run test and only if test fails then they will place a replacement request. That too you need to followup with them for the pickup, they don't come. After replacement if your replaced phone is having some issue (issue will be finalized by THEM) then only they will place an order for refund."

0,"Unhappy with Amazon fake promotional offer , Marketing schemes and dual beahaviour in customer handlingPros:1. Turbo charging2. Touch is scratch resistanceCons:1. You will not get a headphone in the package.2. Amazon promised to give Motorola sports headphone in Rs: 699/- but at the time of purchase I was unable to get one. Later Amazon denied this offer.3. Phone is bulky.4. Dual Camera functionality is hidden and not ui friendly.5. Speaker's Sound is noisy.6. Battery discharge faster than expected7. Both sim not running 4g at a time"
0,"Very good looking phone while seeing feature-wise, but there are many worst things compared to previous Lenovo phones.1. The keys at the bottom I.e. back key and shortcut key are reversed as they were in k4 or k6 etc. Very foolish. How does an existing Lenovo user can upgrade to this phone. Even all other qualities are good, the basic operation of mobile is very difficult. The back key must be on right side for easy and one hand operation.2. These keys must be LED. Otherwise it is difficult to find them in darkness. And on gold colour phone it is very difficult to find them.3. There are no stereo speakers ( one at top and other at bottom ). Then why have to boast about Dolby Atmos. With ear phones there will not be much difference whether Dolby Atmos is on or off. In k4 note the stereo speakers are the best. I am using it from 8 months. Very good 3D sound . But you can't get from k8 note.4. In addition to play button on side, additional 2 buttons previous and next are to be provided. Then this will be an excellent music phone....""Oh God, please gift us k9 note with all specs as of k8 note and speakers as in k4 note with back key on right side"".. . . D. Goury Manohar Reddy"

0,"A real Killer. Basic bluetooth function does not work. Buyers, google for ""Lenovo K8 Note bluetooth"" and you will find lot of complaints on lenovo forums. They have still not managed to reslolve it. It does not connect to my Garmin. Nor does it connect to Car stereo. Connection breaks off frequently. I do not even have the option of returning it.My second disappointment with Lenovo in 6 months. Never again!Does not even have ant+ which I though would be a basic feature it would manage to carry.I am not someone to spread negative reviews and this is the first time that I am so disappointed with a product that I have to post a negative review (I always used to think that those who post negative reviews are paid off by competitors but thanks Lenovo, I now trust all naysayers !)"

0,Few problems I am facing with this phone- Battery drains too fast.- Lags in audio output in bluetooth devices such as speakers and headphones.- No option to turn on MiraCast or screen mirroring.- network issues.- Camera is not that great. Average camera with worst ever bookeh effect.Lenovo should fix this issue in next update otherwise it will lose another customer.Customers are not the priority for lenovo that is for sure.Lenovo please take care of this issue. Do not make rubbish.After Oreo update it is getting worse.Functionality of phone getting worse.Headphones not working. Battery is getting discharged so easilyHeating up issues while charging as well as when not in use with with 20 to 30% discharge.This is for you lenovo please release update to fix these issues.
1,Mst phone camera results v gudLittle heating problemTurbo charger not working good take 3 hrs to full charge
1,The phone is nice and camera quality is quite good but the bokeh mode is just fine
0,"Overall the phone is good. But in just 15 days I found a problem with the proximity sensor. The screen would get activated while talking and GPS etc. would get activated. Also, while playing games the display brightness fluctuates. Now it's too late to return the phone :(Update 20/06/2018--------------------------It's just about 6 months, so thought of sharing an update. The specs of this phone are very impressive and I loved using the phone. But that's about it. Here are the problems I faced:1) Proximity sensor defective. The phone screen would sometimes not switch off and GPS, airplane mode etc. would get activated accidentally while talking2) Bluetooth connectivity is horrible.Sometimes the sound would completely get broken up making it impossible to use it with bluetooth headphones3) While typing a message random characters would automatically get typed, and even after deleting them some more would again appear. Had to quit the application and try again.My earlier phone was a Lenovo K4 note and within 3 months the screen started getting a yellow smudge on one side, then started the problem with random characters getting typed. That phone didn't last a year. Seeing the impressive specs I again went for Lenovo K8 note. Bad mistake!.Unless Lenovo gets their quality issues sorted out they are in for a tough time ahead. I have had enough of Lenovo phones. Sold my phone within 6 months."
0,"Turbo charging has no sense in it. Lenovo provided 3A charger with turbo charging. It takes 2 hours to full charge from 0% to 100% if i doing nothing. Heating very much. Frequently close many apps. Some reviewss says that it charge 40% in 20 minutes is totally wrong as I am experiencing. As camera and battery just average, this phone is below the average phone. Its cost should have been under 10k."

Battery back up getting 1.5 days with moderate use. If you use heavily then only one day you will get. As Oreo update is promised with Google security peaches on time and a clean Google operating system without bloatware you can live with this well built phone.

0,It's a worst mobile I have seen ever. after getting its hanging and battery also not charging fast
1,Camera is so good but battery life is not with the given features
0,"This phone is just about ok.It feels good in the hand, sturdy and body.But thats where it ends.1. The phone ringer is pretty low - you cannot hear the phone in a different room, even if it is at full volume.2. There is some issue with the firmware, because of which alarms keep getting missed regularly (even with 3rd party apps).3. After 6 months, it has become slow.4. For some reason, any Gallery app I use, cannot access the SD card - tried several things, but does not work.5. Most importantly - the data network goes on an off intermittently and is extremely slow. After showing to the Lenovo Care store, they kept it for 5 days and then asked me to take it back since they were yet not able to figure out the issue.Better products are available in the market. Don't go for this one."

0,"purchased on middle of November... by February suddenly stop working, charging was not happening given to servicing.. waiting for the phone for the last four days ...i heard that this is common with lenovo phones..this was my first post...Please see whats happened later on...My self Dr. Prajith, Writing from Veraval, Gujarat. I have purchased LenovoK8 Note K8 through Online (Amzone) on 16th October 2017. In the month of February 2018, suddenly one day the phone showed malfunctioning. the charging was not happening , but the charger symbol was on. I have approached nearby mobile mechanic he advised me to sent Lenovo centere. in Vereval there was no centre for Lenovo. so he himself took the responsibility and sent for servicing with original bill. after the waiting of 10-15 days, i got my mobile back.all the data and contacts were lost and he informed that the it was a software problem. (i paid some amount to the fellow as some handling charge) but still the problem with charging was not was rectified. the charging was happening only of kept in some particular position. now suddenly again my phone got dead. it is less than 6 month after purchase."

I expected battery issues with Andriod but not so early."

The charging was very fast, with in 2-3 hrs, it was getting fully charged.I start to use it by 8:00 am. Usual usage like phone, whatsapp and fb. By 9:30 I reach office, after that, Net usage only 10 mins average per hour. Calls 2-3 mins average per hour.But the phone gets drained off to 0% by 1 pm.This was going on from May 1st to May 15th.From May 15th Tuesday, it takes more than 8 Hrs for charging.Now, this is not a phone, mobile phone or smart phone. I have to keep it in charging all the time. Evenings and Travel are a night mare.You can imagine the feeling of a charge less phone in hand.The issue with customer service station is that, they work till evening 6 pm.

0,Maybe lenovo is going down hill... I had been using Lenovo products and fell in love with them since 2012... But this? This is a joke...Complains :-1. when i first use it... Start up took around 8 minutes.. and even getting longer and longer the more often i restart the phone.2. When on call the volume automatically starts to come down to the lowest3. Camera zooming is terrible.. front cam is terrible... can't even take or screenshot a single while recording in video.4. Battery need to be charged 2-4 times every single day and night5. Lots of heating up when used or in charging mode6. Phone hangs alot..I can't believe Lenovo has launch such a terrible phone... Even the lenovo K5 Note was better... Which i had used before.

0,"YES.......a new mid ranged dual camera phone.This phone can be your daily driver,but dont except more from it.The specs are preety good....but i think its is overpriced.The camera quality is good....but i dont find it amazing.Yes one thing i really like is the near stock android expirience with nougut.....and one bonus is the front flash...thatmay be a life saver in dark.At the end i think if you are giving 14000 (approx.).....you can buy Mi A1 for only 15000."
1,"One of the best smartphones that you can get in this price range. Stock Android makes it even better. Camera is average. Battery can give you full 1 day backup, also takes less time to charge, thanks to turbo charger. I'm fully satisfie with my purchase."

They are not providing refund instead they are providing replacement, after getting this much flaws, i was thinking of other company mobile options.

0,"3rd class mobile, Charging problem ,"
0,"Been using this device for last 90 days or so and here are my findings about it.Cons:1. Rear Camera Perfomance is Average, even with the patch update, the photos feel average, the Bokeh Effect is absolutely below par,2. Battery Life is below average, despite being a 4000mAh , the device does not last a 1 day, even on medium usage, the phone idle and screen it self consumes half the power. The recent update made the battery life worse.3. Despite having a fingerprint scanner, it does not have native app lock feature, and we have to download a third party app for locking apps.4. Memory management is not up to the mark. On first boot, out of 3gb, only about 1.2 gb was free, despite being a stock android, it has a heavy memory footprint despite not having any apps installed.5. Signal reception even on strong coverage areas is poor, tested with Idea/Jio/Vodafone all show very weak signal strength, my other honor device has no issues picking up signal at the same locations.6. Turbo charger failed to live up to it's potential after the recent November update, the device takes more then 110-130 minutes to fully charge,WORTHWHILE to note, all the above problems could be solved via better OTA updates but lenovo does have a strong update policy because of which earlier devices performed poorly after launchPRO's:1. Great Build Quality, device feels very premium thanks to the series 6000 Aluminium Build,2. Stock Android OS offers up a lag free operation,3. Dolby Sound is a very good offering, even without stereo speakers, the device outs good audio,4. the Front Camera with Flash is a good feature and the camera does perform well,"

0,Not a good product many issues in headphone jack software apps shuts done suddenly not gud camera in love light
0,"It's the jack of all trades but king of none. Battery back up could have been better if they used some other processor. Battery drains quite fast. Camera is better than average. And I think there is no option to keep external media as your ringtone. Only custom build ringtones available to set as your ringtone. Kinda bums me out.Update after 3 day use:Battery back up is really horrible, normal usage like whatsapp and Instagram browsing consumes more than 25% battery in an hour or so.Then there is turbocharging issue, it starts with fast charging then after 10-20 minutes,depending upon mood, rate decreases, it took 7 hours to charge it by 40% in total.Would really appreciate if Amazon could take this matter seriously and take it up with Lenovo and return the money of its customers for defective models. I personally would not trust my 14K bucks with Lenovo or Moto from this point on."

0,"Hiii all.I have used this phone from last 3 days.Here is my reviewPros:1. The metal body gives a classic and stylish look2. Internal memory 64 gb in this range awesome with 4 gb ram.3.Touch is very good with Full Hd.4.Video recording in slow motion is also available.5.New processor is fast but not as compared with snapdragon 825.Cons:1. The camera quality is very poor though it has extra camera in back.Similarly front camera of 13MP is not up to mark and it's look like fake images.2.Battery which claimed to to be of 4000MAh is just like 3000mah of samsung or other phones.It drains out within 16-24hr time.3.Turbo charging,Lenevo just fooling customers in this section it takes almost 2.5 hr to charge complete mobile.4.It doesn't have separate ring volume adjustment for media alaram message etc.5.No headphones provided by Lenevo in this set."
1,Camera performance is some what satisfied but overall good Device

0,"I purchased this phone on 25th August, hence writing this review after almost 3.5 months of use.There are problems I have with this phone1. Clock: If you are using the phone with display on, the clock doesn't change, it remains still. You won't realize the time even after 30 minutes. It's annoying2. Wifi: It doesn't connect to the Wifi every time. You may have to restart this device to get it done.3. Heating: The phone heats up during charging and heavy usage4. Battery: My previous phone with 3500 mAh lasted more than this phone's 4000 mAh. The battery performance is bad according to me.5. Full charge: It takes more than two hours for the phone to get charged.6. Display: Display is okay. (if you are an AMOLED fan, you will be disappointed with this)Good points:1. Performance: 4GB RAM does justice to phone's performance. No lags noticed even with heavy usage and many apps2. Camera: Camera quality is good. Also, the portrait mode.At 13,999 I believe there are better options in the market.Overall Rating: 3/5"
1,"Compared to all brands in this range like Moto,Nokia,Samsung it gives complete value for money. Whether it is battery,storage,camera, video,sound,style or any other criteria k8 note is unbeatable in rs15000 range, anybody can blindly go for it"
1,I go value for money. The battery lasts 2 days. Simplistic. Nothing fancy and ostentatious. Value for money spent. Both Lenovo and Motorola are good. Reasonable budget phones.
1,Good phone. Don't buy for dual camera setup.
1,"Excellent... Accept heating issue,cam, battery"
1,Excellent phone must buy
0,Product is good. But heating problem and battery drain is biggest. I bought this on 1st March this year. Sometimes very slow. I want to replace it now. Also while typing it takes wrong words
1,Awesome experience of a smart phone...100 out of 100. The superb change which is in this mobile is not felt till now is heating problem in lenevo mobiles....The only thing required is to provide lenevo headphones....For experiencing the Dolby atmosphere...

0,Worst phone with worst services
0,"Pathetic phone.. it ""always"" overheats after using large applications. After 8 months the phone had a starting problem, and the circuit board was 100% damaged as it was the software problem. The service center took 200rs charge just to inform that the phone is no good and upon repairing it will cost 17000 which is hysterical! Cz its more than the price of phone. It was not covered under warranty as there was a minor crack on its cover. Please dont waste your money for this crappy phone also the service center experience was negative and least helpful."

0,"I was using Lenovo k4 note before. I bought this phone with great expectations, but it is not at all up to the mark.1) Camera quality is very poor. Redmi note 4 is way better than this.2) Heating issue, the phone heats even after 5 mins of playing a game or using camera3) loudspeaker quality is not at all good. I think I received a defective piece. volume of the speaker is also very less. Very much disappointed with that.4) Battery drains very fast, even when the phone is idle.5) phone brightness is very low. The maximum brightness level is very low.Lenovo is fooling people by manufacturing these kinds of phones.Buying this phone was my worst decision ever.DONT EVER GO FOR THIS PHONE."

It does not give many features but it is a good phone when we consider its price. Front camera does not give a really good performance.

0,"Lenovo K8 Note is ""on paper"" the best phone in budget phone segment. It's a Killer phone only if you go by specifications otherwise it's a total wastage of your 13-14k.The build quality is ok. Nothing in this phone is above average. Either it is average or below average.Let me tell you why one should not buy it.1) I used Jio sim for my Lenovo K8 Note. The problem is when the phone remains idle for 10mins or something it goes in standby mode i.e. if someone calls me, the caller hears that the phone is switched off but in actual phone is not switched off. The moment I unlock the phone and someone calls me at that time it works fine.So it's the biggest disappointment. It feels I bought video game for 14k. And this is not happening random. It happens every time when phone remains idle for more than 10mins.2) Network connectivity: Network connectivity is very poor in this phone. I tried sim cards from same service provider at same location in two different handsets out of which one is Lenovo K8 Note, and my observation is the other handset gets full network signal but Lenovo K8 Note always shows one-two bar less and that affects the call quality.3) Even though it is having 4000mah battery, the battery performance is very poor. It drains very fast even in idle condition.4) If you are movie/tv series lover and spend most of your time watching videos on phone then this phone will irritate you. Things is when you watch videos on this phone, the screen gets flickering every now and then. It is the most irritating thing. Even after turning auto brightness mode off, the screen keeps flickering.5) Stock Android at it's worst in this phone.6) Dolby Atmos is not doing any magic. Normal music output.7) The hard keys (power, volume, music) are not firm. It is very loosely connect and having too much play. Even your older phone may not have that much play even after years of usage.8) Microphone output is very low so no good calling experience. It may be because of poor Network connectivity as I mentioned earlier.9) Dual camera feature has nothing special. Even third party apps can provide better results than this so called ""depth mode"" camera feature. Overall average camera output.10) No backlight for soft keys. You have to keep searching for soft keys in darkness.All above drawbacks are not specific to my phone only. As I faced these problems, I searched for solution online. Instead of finding solution, I found out many people are having similar issues with their Lenovo K8 note.Apart from phone, I give full marks to Amazon for the hassle free return of Lenovo K8 note.Amazon should refrain itself from selling this phone.Hope my review will help people who wants to buy this ""Killer Phone""."

0,"A decent phone on budget.Pros: Nice specs at this price, brightnessCons: the biggest drawback is music and sound quality. Dolby Atmos is useless and is given to fool people. Even the older Lenovo devices have got far better sound. I am a music lover and purchased this device but super disappointed now.Update: Mobile suddenly stopped working within 3 days of usage. It is not powering 'ON' now, waiting for resolution from Amazon's end."
1,Except camera quality mobile performance is good
1,"Pretty good phone, camera is awesome..Battery lasts 2days ..Over all a good buy"
0,"Very worst handset it doesn't have direct casting instud it requires google crome to connect smart TV as the phone have 4000mh batter, the phone doesn't last for a day even without internet. When we call to Coustomer care regarding the direct casting they speak very lightly. The lenova k5 note was far better then k8note. I guess this all have happened coz of Motorola tookover the lenova product.."

0,"I have read lot of reviews after buying the product and thought the reviews were some bad experience with few people. And there were few positive reviews as well hence went on to buy this product. I was using a K3 note before.My review based on a week's usagePositives:1. Good camera2. Good speed3. Good battery charge4. Good storageNegatives:1. Call quality bad, basic requirement of a phone2. Dolby Atmos performance bad, doesn't even match with my K3 notePlanning to return the phone"

0,"Packaging sucks, there were bubbles an on screen some scratches on back cover too but most of all the Sim ejector tool is missing.. never gonna buy Lenovo products again."
1,Worth it but the sound quality is good but the volume level of the speakers in not up to the mark even in earphone too
1,Best product and amazing delivery
0,Signal range is poor
1,Good phone with lesser price
1,It's a good product I m fully satisfied with it and I really love its camera
1,Great experience with tis amazing product from lenovo.it is equipped with almost every features that a smartphone required.deca core processor long lasting battery and 64GB internal memory with 4GB RAM is just awesome.I would certainly recommend this phone for users having usage and game lovers
0,"Average mobile,so many issue ,I think this is west of money"
1,battery not so longer to use
0,Horrible experience.I have got a Vimbar instead of this phone.please do something immediately.
0,"Didn't like it too much like I do my K5 note, selfie camera doesn't have mirror settings may be some update will be there in future, further more camera is not that good, dual camera is only for show doesn't do anything good. One strange thing I noticed is missing headphones they are writing it in description but not available in box."
1,Good product..worth money...of not looking for extraordinarily camera this is for you to grab..
0,"Battery is not long lasting, it doesn't feel like 4000 mah ..... started getting hot by continuous using, some times it slow while using"
1,Very element phone in this category having very nice front and dual camera.
1,"Decent phone to price tag ....found satisfactory in all terms......After using MI3, red mi 3s,red mi 4,red mi 5and some of samsung /motos found better"
0,Pros:1.Performance(Deca Core) is Good2.Storage(52GB ) is good3.RAM(4B) performance is quite satisfactory no hang has observed so far.4. Camera takes some really good pics in Day light and nowhere in this price range you are gonna get 13 megapixel front camera with a selfie flash.5. People who love to have a lot of multimedia content in their phone as 52 GB of storage is quite enought for that kind of users.6. Fingerprint sensor is amazing and far better than any andoid phone I have ever used. You'll hardly get to clean it for months.7. Since it is already aiming with Corning Gorilla glass so no need to add any screen guard as it can handle even knife point so details you can check its screen resistance in Youtube videos.8. Splash resistant so if by mistake you pour out your tea or water you will have your phone fully working without any damage.9. Screen angle is very good so you can view movies by all possible angles.10. That music key is really awesome especially for the people who listen music and headphones and their phones usually keo in their pocket so next time you dont have to take out your phone and then change the track your can simple do it by double pressing music key.Cons:1.Camera is not up to the mark even my Mi4i camera was better than this one especially in low light areas.2. If you are a kind of person who listen music at loud volume then this phone is not for you as its maximum loundness is very low as compared to other phones even my iPhone 5s sounds better in my headphones than this one.3. Updates will be delayed so if you are excited for the Android oreo than you have to wait till July and June of 2018 as this is their officially announced date for the Updates.4.Back panel captured your sweat finger print pretty fast so don't forget to get a back cover for it although Lenovo provide a transparent plastic back cover but it's better if you go for another option.

If we enabled 4G/3G than it will search and connect with 4G/3G Network and its not necessary that selected network is available everywhere.2. No in built call recorder and only one app on google play store with limited feature for call recording option.3. As usual heating problem.I just want to return this mobile set

1,Excellent product
1,good and very nice
0,"This phone is too heavy and feels like a rock in my jeans and 185 gms is actually quite heavy and is uncomfortable to hold. That depth mode in camera which they advertised is a joke and a gimmick. Don't buy this phone for camera. 5 mins of Pokemon Go and this device feels like I'm holding a hot pan. And 5 mins of listening to music also starts to heat up the device. You may think that this phone has 10 core processors so its heats up but why the hell would a phone heat up while listening to music and using camera, i have used many phones but i have never seen heating like this before. The top part of the back and the screen becomes very hot. The game lags when the device becomes hot and the battery starts to drain very fast (I used playing WiFi and not 4G and I'm sure the device would become more hot while using 4G). I had to shut down the phone to cool it down. The ram management is very poor and sometimes apps will reload while heavy multi tasking. Lenovo may fix these problems with software updates but Lenovo is famously known for NOT pushing updates to any of its phone. I asked the customer care of Lenovo if they'll push any updates but they had no information regarding this matter. In my opinion, its better you skip this phone and pay Rs.2000 extra for the Moto G5s Plus.I requested Amazon to retun the product and they said to use the SmartCheck app which showed a temperature of about 44 degrees Celsius. Amazon listened to the problem and they promptly sent a technician to my home and he frankly said to return the device as in a period of 6 months or so, this device would cause more problems and i did return this phone. Thanks to an Amazon agent, i got a refund instead of a replacement of this device which is against their policy."
0,Bad product. My charger has stopped working within 2 months.

1,NICE PRODUCT
1,Its such a amazing handset in its range fsb performance nice battery back up
0,"Let me start with the Cons firstCons :1) GPS tracking is incorrect. If you use any activity tracking app for running, walking etc then get ready to see incorrect readings2) Dual camera setup is a total gimmick feature. Though primary 13MP is good.3) The front camera has some filter mode enabled by default which produces grainy pics. Pro cam mode is better.4) Phone heats up sometimes unnecessarily though not a big con.5) Headphone/Earphone volume output less6) Dolby Atmos is a big failure. It actually lowers the sound output.7) No backlit illuminated navigation buttons. Get's tough in dark.Pro1) Excellent power output.2) Sound output good3) Good Voice clarity4) All features rather than the cons work perfectly.VerdictFine for the price it is offered for but the phone doesn't live up to the mark as compared to the publicity/marketing Lenovo did for this product isn't."

1,Awesome phone in terms of processing and camera quality. This is the first time I could experience Android phone having no lags while playing games. The only problem I could find is the phone charges for a long time even though it came with a turbo charger
1,Best product
0,"Worth buying for the price.1. Nice vibrant display and smooth stock android UI.2. Performance is smooth without any lag issues. The phone doesn't heat up during normal usage but with heavy gaming it tends to become quite warm(but still playable) and might be a concern for you if you're an avid gamer.3.Sound is Ok, nothing special as there's just one functional speaker on the bottom right. Left one's just for show.4. Some features such as screen mirroring and call record(in phone app) options(usually included in Lenovo phones) are missing but may be used with third party apps.5. Both front and back cameras are decent enough for me but the depth effect(dual camera) doesn't work that well.6.Overall look is stylish and build quality is decent. Doesn't feel too heavy to hold and feels sturdy.7. Battery life is Ok you can get 10-11 hours of continuous usage(more time for normal everyday use)."

Phones gets heated up while charging, but it cools down immediately once the charging is over. It takes 2 hours for full charging. Little over weight still design is handy and loving. No hanging or heating issues while using. Battery last for more than a day with good usage of 4G. Dolby atmos feature is really cool. Overall a good budget phone from lenovo."
1,"So far so good. My priorities were internal memory, RAM and battery back up. Other features are similar to phones in this price range. There is a finger print sensor/phone lock mechanism which is great. The camera could have better in low light. In all, good purchase given the price. Amazon delivery was on time as well."

1,An amazing phone....Pros-1. Excellent cameras (both front selfie camera & rear primary camera) in this price range. Even low light photography using flash in both the cameras was far better than other phones in the 15k range. The camera is fast and very responsive.2. A superfast phone for people who multitask a lot. Didn't even hang with heavy online gaming.3. Superb battery backup. Even with the data continuously on and continuous gaming the battery gives a backup of more than 6 hrs. Lasts more than 12 hrs with normal usage. And with the turbo charging feature the phone charges real fast.4. The phone has a premium look.5. Comes with preloaded Microsoft office package.Cons-1. Is the company fooling us by saying that it's a Gorilla glass????? My phone fell lightly from less than a feet and the display got shattered.
1,That phone is very good processor is also good look is also excelent

0,Except phone gets warm very fast battery performance is not as described one simple word for this phone is awesome. Headset is not provided with the box. Also in this version gallery is not available so arranging your photos and videos are little difficult.Would like to edit this review after using it so many days. Problem After lenovo upgraded android version to Naugat the real pain started. Phone is reaching temperature upto 65‚ÑÉ. Battery giving backup only upto 4-5 hrs after full charge even if you are not doing anything with it.Called customer care and visited service center but they told me getting that much warm is normal.Probably next time they if this phone burst will tell bursting is also normal.

But most annoying issue I am facing since 1st day of delivery that it heats up so much for small usage . My palm get irritated . I tried to contact Amazon but they said temp is below 45 degree celcius so it's acceptable. And they denied replacement .I am feeling like being duped. I can't hold phone more than 10 min in hand .

1,"It's good , feeling pleasant performances"
0,Good mobile phone but camera is not good
0,Not enough battery
0,The phone has good features on paper. Even performance is fine. The thing is the back camera lens is very weak. It just got broken after 3 weeks of use. The mishap is happened unknowingly since my phone didn't fall but i accept the fact that it might have happened due to keys maybe. Service center quoted 2650 rupees for replace only back panel and yet the back panel is not available in service center. They are gonna order it from somewhere so the guy has to keep my phone for 2 days to complete procedure from his end. Then they will return my phone and after 15 days the back panel will arrive. So again i need to hit their door. So now in two days i am afraid that they shouldn't stole any spare parts.

0,Really pissed off with the product. This is the first product I bought from amazon not even 2 months the phone is switching off automatically not responding at tyms ..apps suddenly stops working etc. Bought mobiles from Flipkart earlier still no issues working perfectly fine. Extremely disheartening with the product delivered by Amazon.
0,Phone is lagging frequently
0,"Very very poor product. Moved from Moto to Lenovo for first time and surely, this will be the last time. The specs are just highlighted but the phone is half as good as the phones with lower specs. Very disappointing."
0,"The phone was working great until it was running on Android 8. Lenovo published an update from Android 8 to 9. After the update the phone is near to useless. I have to full charge it 3 times in a day. The battery is draining too quickly and the turbo charger has stopped working. Due to heavy CPU usage after the update the phone is always heating. I upgraded the OS in May and started getting the issues. I went to service center and they presented with only one solution, that is to wait until a software update arrives. It has been two months and I have still not received any update.If you are planning to buy this phone then please refrain from upgrading it to Oreo. Otherwise this phone is good."
0,I got this product from Amazon but unfortunately the charger is not working. I wish if it can be replaced.
0,"Im still using a Lenovo k5 note I find audio speakers better than this k8 note,only on this basis im not fully satisfied with this k8 note.On the other hand k8 note is really a killer phone as they said at this price point it's really a best buy 4gigs of ram n 64gigs of internal dedicated and card slot that means you can use 2 Sims n SD card both that's what i like about this k8 note.Over all its a best buy,but im not fully satisfied with the audio quality as of k5 notes speakers we can really feel the real bass in some heavy bass songs.Anyway thanks Lenovo ¬Æ for this amazing phoneI ‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Lenovo ¬Æ"

Not Happy in overall , before purching this model I assumed this was good set ..

0,"As shown in ad it's not a killer, cameras are not up to the mark. Only two things are great one is touch pad and finger sensor. All major applications are belongs to Google only. Lenovo doesn't own any app, not any music player themes, wallpaper, not even set our own ringtone."

0,"Worst product, returning back......Display flickering.....Horizontal lines fluctuating on keypad...."
1,Very Good.
0,"The cons are as follows:1.Battery does not last more than 8 hours with typical usage. A toy in front of Redmi Note 4.2. Terrible performance of both front and rear camera in low and transient lighting condition. Focussing barely happens. Even if it does, it takes 2-3 seconds and get lost.3. Depth mode is a joke. It blurrs the hair if you try to focus on the face."

0,Very poor performanceMany times reboot automatically in a dayServices and apps are auto stopped.
0,"Update: from the past few days my k8 note is taking more than 8 hours to charge. I am using the original charger that shipped with this phone. The turbo charging has stopped. Lenovo will ask to carry it to their service center. Too frustrating.The phone is fast due to the RAM and processor. However, none of the Lenovo phones have a good camera. I wish I had again bought the Honor6X which I use for myself, as the Lenovo was a gift to someone. I bought it considering the dual camera feature but this is nowhere close to the camera quality that Honor 6X provides.- The photos are not clear and are grainy.- The camera app does not have filter modes like night-mode, beauty mode, slow motion for video.- However, the phone is not bulky and has a Gorilla glass. The back cover is a good add-on.- The battery optimisation feature is not that effective.- Badge count for apps (whatsapp unread count on icon) is not available.- Navigation keys are not illuminated.I would advice Honor6x in case people are looking for a quality camera phone. The Pro model is also good if people are willing to shell out more."

0,"Review after using the phone for 6 month. One of the worst product of Lenovo. I guess Lenovo itself has become worst now.4 GB ram - never felt like using 4 GB. no ram management. phone slowed down in 6 monthscreen - All lenovo phone has screen issues. pale yellow mark automatically comes and screen wil be non responsive from that part.camera - worst camera even seen. even a 2000 rs phone might have better camCustomer carre support - worst ever.buy Lenovo phones to waste your money. if you want a good phone with the speccs declared as in ad, then go for any brand but not for Lenovo...My phone is in warrantee. called multiple times but they don't bother abbt helping you. they just asked me to put my phone with Lenovo support, it will be with them till they find any issues else thry will return it in a month or so. ( a month for finding issue in phone??)planning to throw the phone soon and bye bye to Lenovo for ever."

1,It's just an amazing phoneIt has only one cons I. EIt gets warm up quicklyBut an ama phone
0,"I had purchased this mobile and returned on next day after observing the reviews from other users on Amazon. Let me brief you on the details:1. I liked this phone from the day when i saw its ad on amazon, look and feature were awesome.2. Camera great, front is also great.3. No need to doubt on sound there is Dolby Atmos which is a plus point of the phone.4. On first time charging and video playing and games, it gets warmed a bit but that's too because i was suspecting as mentioned on reviews ....it's a normal heat nothing you can say as a negative point.5. No lagging6. Only concerns are:a) Battery draining is not usual. Without use also charging% gets decrease. For example: in 4 hours after a full charge got discharge up to 22%. I had played a 5 minutes video and played 2 games for 5- 7 minutes only.May be this is due to processor as power management is not proper.b) Network signal is not showing with full bar. However it was not impacting call performance or data performance.Sometimes there won't be a single bar of network but if you dial a number or try to open google....call will get connected and signal will appear on phone or google will work without any issue.If Lenovo fix the problem by updates for battery draining and signal then this is definetly a great buy.Unfortunately i had to return this phone as there is no solution at present.Finally a great appreciation for Amazon representative who did a health check of my phone and initiated a return.Now time to check my account for the refund amount.üòã"
1,Your product is good quality so thank you
0,"front panel gets too hot with even normal usage. It's back panel always feels warm and after few minutes of usage I cant even make call because it gets too hot for my ear to bear. What is the use of other cool things which we can do with this device if we can't perform the most basic function of calling ( without feeling the heat), browsing etc. The device always feels warm in your hand and a simple 10 mins of browsing and then you cant hold it against your ear to make a call,yes, it gets this hot."

Fingerprint works smooth and fast, speakers are awesome, Dolby sound is a plus, 4 GB ram makes it super smooth and fast,screen display is perfect with actual colors, go for it at rs 12,000/- (discount price). Time to se how long it lasts."

Amazon both offer as idea 343 is can't utilised because idea best offers are not showing it, as I have added Motorola sports headphone also but it's shown at not available in stock. At now it's cost is 1599.00, in phone box there is no any headphone , so Amazon is making fool in both offers"

0,"Phone doesn't come with new system updates as claimed in the description. I had to download and install 4 system updates. Even though it was not much of a trouble, still that's cheating the customer with wrong claims and is not acceptable. Review of the product will be put up soon."

0,Horrible product.1st one had network reception problem.Replacement had the same along with additional speaker problem.Kudos to Amazon team for assisting in hassle free refund of sum paid.
0,It works like an costliest induction stove when I use more than 15 minutes. Network signal strength very. Worst. Please give money to orphanage or other social networks instead of buying this worst and waste mobile. This mobile surely ruins Amazon's reputation. So amazon don't promote this mobile.

0,"I bought the Lenovo K8 Note on Amazon. I'm deeply disappointed by the phone's performance. The 4000 MaH battery surprisingly lasts less than 24 hours even with minimal usage. The fingerprint scanner cannot recognize my finger print. The WiFi feature gets disconnected after a couple of minutes even when the signal is strong. I've a feeling Darshita Electronics, the seller, has sold me a lemon! Unfortunately, I cannot return the product as I started using after the date by which I could have returned it."
1,Nice products
0,"Hello,The phone starts resetting itself randomly. This issue starts after after 3 days of use, especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two. The issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days, then I tried few option mentioned in Lenovo help APP which is pre-installed(I am feeling like a stupid for having done this) , after that for 4 or 5 days it didn't show this issue. Now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night. Use the phone in night, then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning, boom, it is dead already. And when you manually power-on there is enough juice left in the battery. Not sure what to do with this kind of issue, the phone is absolutely useless.When I approached amazon for return, they are quoting policy and suggest me that I should run pillar to post to get problem rectified (not sure even it is rectifiable issue), The below Amazon's tagline tag-line sounds funny"" Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company."", I am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean, I am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in Amazon and now I realized that buying Lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage."

0,"Ordered for my cousin and received within 2 days thanks to Amazon. Stock android was the foremost reason to buy this mobile since stock android has benefits of smooth usage, relatively less load on cpu and better battery backup. But this mobile heats up for normal usage. Forget gaming, it's getting very hot for streaming on YouTube. Battery backup isn't good because of over heating. Camera is just okay. Practically, redmi note 4 is much better and moto g5 plus is recommended."

I noted this only after few days and now Amazon won't return the product as well. I researched about this on the internet and found other users are also facing this issue. I am trying to figure out if this issue can be resolved but Lenovo as a brand has lost its value and I won't recommend buying any of its phone ever."

0,"I bought this one at the first flash sell. Here is my review after using this for a long time:Pros:-Dedicated mmc slot-A configurable hardware key-Dolby sound enhancement-Powerful CPU-Front camera is really good+Front flash-Compass sensor (This was a deciding factor for me)-Stock android (This could be both advantage as well as disadvantage. Its good for those who wants simple phone and the advanced users who need root etc. Those who wants great readymade ui features, don't go for stock android. I am a root user but the problem is official kernel source not available)-A gesture which lowers ringing volume when u pick up the phone-Fast fingerprint sensorCons:-Dual rear camera is a total crap. It can't detect edges properly-No 4K recording and time lapse which you should expect at this price range-Have tones of software bugs (ex- display brightness flickering while watching YouTube for a long time)-Notification LED only works with Missed call, sms and Gmail app-Battery backup isn't good-Have heating issue-Build quality: The phone is heavyweight. I can't use vr headset more than 30 min. Primary lense is getting dust easily. I have to clean it every 2 months.-Lenovo's ota update: Lenovo is superslow in providing ota updates. Users have reported all the bugs present in the phone. Though Lenovo isn't taking actions.So, if you need a dedicated sd slot+compass sensor, then go for it. Otherwise there is no reason to buy this phone."

Within 3 hours of normal usage like what's app, checking of mails and music listening ,the battery drops down from 100% to 26% . The quick charging is crap , it takes 6 hours for my phone to get charged from 26% to 90%. Typing of this review is taking around 10 minutes as phone is getting hanged continuously . Call reception is very poor , at Thane station I don't get internet signals. I don't use camera or gaming and I feel pity for plight of such users. This phone is not capable of normal functions leave the smart fucntions . I feel like throwing this phone due to constant irritation .I strongly recommend don't buy this phone as it offers amazing features on paper for cheap price .I also fell in the same trap"

1,Good mobile under 12000
1,Awesome phone
0,Dont buy this phone. Its really a Chinese product..... even if it is giving 4300 mah batrery it works fine for just first 3 months then it actually starts showing its true color. Its battery sucks like normal phone. its not even works for contineous 6 hours. Try another phone. I wasted my 13k on this. so its my humble warning.
0,It is very slowly charged and fastly completed.
0,"There is no Gorilla glass. I received the broken screen product. Is Gorilla Glass so delicate really.... It's Just fake publicity. The proximity sensor was not working correctly. Battery Is draining fast, it won't last for the day....Hardly 7-8 hours after full chargeGot replacement after too much of hard work and calling. Delivery boy was not taking the product. Need to call customer care to convince him. Getting replacement from Amazon is a very tedious task. Flipkart replacements are very easy and no questions asked.....Plzz DO NOT update to Oreo...Battery draining too fast...Mobile getting so hot that u can iron your shirt....Overall not happy with everything...."

0,This phone does not support cast feature which it‚Äôs earlier variant were supporting like K5 note.Casting only works with chrome cast for which you spend another 3300 bucks.After Oreo update the phone heats up like anything and dries up the battery.After K5 note I had set my expectations high from Lenovo but this phone is a BIG disappointment.
1,"Really good camera quality,loved the touch and screen enlagrment, really smooth, enough space, the best part is the dual camera facility at the back, and as well as loved everything about this phone.. dual SIM slot along with memory card, when received already there was a back cover and screen card on it, best phone under 12000, really very much satisfied, user of 10 days only"

0,"I bought this phone and within one week the problem begins. The battery heats up during charging and won't charge more than 60% in 5 hours. I called up customer care and after a thorough examination, I could luckily get a refund from Amazon. So if you think about buying this phone be prepared to waste a couple of days dealing with customer care."
0,It emits a lot of Heat. can't hold it for longer period in hands and near ear while talking. I purchased ear phones and using them as alternative.The screen got scratches when i put it in my pocket along with bike keys. Before buying i saw Bharat Nagpal - Igyaan video in youtube. He showed that the screen wont get scratches even with knife. But its wrongMobile lags when playing small game like Candy Crush. Forget about playing big games.Battery is down in less than 5 hours. Turbo Charger is for name sake. full battery charging takes 1 hr 30 mins.

1,Call recording and video call using time not working front camera light
0,This phone doesn't meet my expectations. After using it for three days i found that this phone is lacking so much responding slow camera quality is not good even after having two rear cameras. This phone makes me think as i am using an old phone. There are so many bugs in this phone. Sometimes clock is not showing up the right time. Overall bad experience. I choose this phone over redmi note 4 and i think i made a bad decisio. For the first time i purchased lenovo and it is a bad experience. The only good thing about this phone is dolby atmos. You can get better options to choose from in this price segment.
0,The phone has no wireless display system. As such you can't use it with smart TV. This is major drawback of the phone.
1,Good phone. The only two cons are the heating issue while charging and the camera quality not up to the mark.

1,"I am giving my review after using this phone for more then a week.Here are some pros and cons i have listed based on my personal use.Cons:1. Battery drains faster at idle time.2. Depth sensor of dual camera is not perfect, the edges of the subject gets blurred.3. Doesn't come with call record feature, but you can install Boldbeast recorder app for that.4. Contacts Doesn't display contacts from sim card.5. lock screen doesn't lock instantly when phone screen goes off, you can still swipe to unlock.(U can lock it by pressing the unlock icon on lock screen for 3 seconds.)(Hoping lenovo will fix these bugs and release the updates shortly.)Pros:1. Phone charges from 0-100% in 2 hours. My old k5 phone would take more then 3 hours to charge.It takes around 3-4 hours to charge with a 5V 2.0A charger, and 4-5 hours with a 5V 1.0A charger.(Phone gets a little warm while charging with the turbo charger but with 5V 2.0A and 1.0A charger the phone temperature doesn't increase at all.)Charging stops automatically with battery is fully charged.2. Rear Camera has Professional feature which allows you to manually adjust the focus with a slider(Hats off to that), you can adjust the shutter speed too.It has an Auto HDR mode for both front and rear camera.Photos come good at low light conditions.3. Phone gets a little warm while playing higher end games with data or wifi on, doesn't heat a lot like other mediatek phones do.4. music quality is great with dolby atmos.5. Easily gives backup for 4-5 hours while playing games with wifi or data on. For normal use battery lasts for an entire day.(Install Greenify for longer battery backup).6. Display Lighting is great even in outdoors.Reply for some misleading reviewers:-1. This phone has google music to play audio And it has google photos app instead of gallery and you can view videos using it.2. Some people complainging about poor music quality most probably have a music player app which controls the audio drivers using its own equilizer, which in turn disables the dolby atmos.3. I had no network issues with my phone, Signal strength is good.4. Phone never restarted on its own at any point of time.5. I did not experience any performance drop.6. I did not experience any call drops.7. Wifi gets connected almost instantly when turned on."

1,"I liked the design and sound quality, display it's good it's heats a bit, but it's fine. Due to metal body, phone processor is super fast"
0,"I purchased the above phone on first sale in Amazon. No doubt it is a good phone. But I don't find anything extraordinary other than 'Deca Core', separate slots for two SIMS and SD card and looks. The phone gets heated very fast. The main drawback I noticed is that 'Lenovo K8 Note' fails to connect when the 'Mobile Data' is switched on. At that time one is not able to upload or download any audios or videos or pictures except receiving and forwarding chat messages. On such occasions, one finds a small 'x' at the below right end of the coverage icon of service provider. Thereafter, it was noticed that phone could not detect any nearby device through bluetooth. And soon after a few days, it was noticed that the phone would not connect to Wi Fi also. Therefore, the smartphone became almost useless for me.Thus, I find that Lenovo K8 Note is one of the worst device. I was forced to return the device and I must appreciate AMAZON for their prompt response in arranging RETURN PICK and also issuing refund on the same day. So the only good experience in purchasing the above phone was the amazing service provided by AMAZON."

0,Good speed and performance with ultra fast touch sensor but having some problems like you can't save the new contacts in your SIM
0,"On paper seems to be the best. I bought it in the first flash sale. Dual camera doesn't seem to be so promising. Headphone output very inferior, Dolby Atmos has to be superior but it is inferior to even the low range phones. Battery too doesn't behave as 4000 mah. Some software lags.. the double touch to wake isn't consistant. Few minute features missing as it is stock Android like no vibration when charger connected, no battery percentage indicator while charging. Unimpressed with it in comparison with K4 and k5 note. Hence returned it. Giving 2 rating only keeping in view of its features listed on paper. Lenovo has to do a lot to uplift it's performance and service centres too. The availability of accessories is also cumbersome, though available the price is not similar at all service centres located in the same city. After introduction of GST a few service centres are hesitant to give bill and warranty to accessories; indicating unprofessional practices from Lenovo."

0,After using the phone for 1 week found these serious problems...Battery drains very quickly even if you keep the phone in idle it still loses 10-15% battery from 100% (it drains 10-13% overnight)Signal bar continously fluctuating up and down. Even i am standing on a cell phone tower ( Cell tower is 50 meters from my house) there is still not full network on my phone.Signal bar changes continuously which results on poor battery life.Earpiece volume is too low i can't hear the caller's voice clearly and call quality is also poor.Notification light doesn't work properly.Camera depth enabled option have issue in taking photos. Blur is not perfect in edges.Heats up too much during browsing or video playback.Music quality is not good even it has Dolby Atmos the sound is too low in earphone (tried in 2-3 earphones)Incoming Calls Not Working in VOLTE(LTE) When the phone is in idle mode for 5min.

0,"Amazon shipping was excellent. The product came in just 2 days.Pros:1) Looks and feel of premium quality. Overall a good phone for the price.2) Separate music/ programmable key button is nice to have.3) Selfie Flash helps in the low light area.4) 4000mAH Battery and 4GB and 64 GB memory.5) Two nano sims with separate tray for external memory card.Cons1) Heating is a big issue. Phone heats up a lot even when not playing those high end games. though it does not degrade performance.2) Camera -> Average- Pic taken from Lenovo K8 16 MP Front camera with flash in low light turned out to be inferior than my friends 1 Plus 5 16MP camera without flash. Even without flash- Pics taken from Rear dual camera 16MP (in regular mode) came out blurry (1st pic) . and it seems they added auto beautification to make pic smooth, which did not help. My older Coolpad Note 3 with 13MP was much sharper (2nd pic)3) Battery even fully charged drained out by 60% in 6 ours with normal usage. When I play Golf Clash it drains out much faster. If I play continuously, I believe the phone might die out in less than 3 hours.4) The phone feels little heavier.5) Box does not come with Headphones or scratch guard.6) Back button is on the left side different than other phones. Also The bottom keys are not back lit."

0,First of all earphones are not provided with the phones but what about its itnernal features lenovo has done changes that we cannot record the call like in earlier models.And as per the specifications instead being available on discount the phone is quite costly as compared to other phones present in market with more and great latest features available.And the thing I needed the most call recording is missing. I request to send an ugrade for the same as soon as possible. Rest phone is working fine till now lets see further.And for Amazon atleast keep the return window open for 10 days.

1,So far so good
1,Good product but have no fast charging
0,"Not satisfied by this phone. Not as per expectations.- Heats a lot (curtosy: Mediatek processor)- battery life isn't great (doesn't even last a complete day on average usage, keeps draining quickly even on standby - I don't have many power intensive apps)- not very ergnomic to hold. The corners are very sharp.- camera is ok-ok. Dual camera (depth mode) isn't precise. While recording videos, I have noticed the lens is focusing multiple times.. and as a result it keeps blurring and focusing giving a poor outcome video when u see the video again later.- visibility under sunlight is not that great. Brightness is generally less. If u increase brightness means it consumes more power.- takes a long long time to charge. Wonder why they call turbo charging.- I noticed some issue with my handset, not sure if it's common across Lenovo K8 note. Although there are 2 speakers, left ones is very weak. The right speaker is strong and loud.I wouldn't recommend this phone, especially when there are good phones in price bracket. Moto g5s plus is much better choice - even if it means spending few bucks extra."

0,"This is just an average phone with above average specs mentioned in sale document.What's good- Screen size is large and good if you like it- Value for money is goodWhat could have been better or is not that good- The camera is below average inspire of having a dual camera. The pictures in low light is quite poor.- the back button is on left side of bottom screen, so one hand operation is not easy- Battery life is good as per specifications but in reality it hardly lasts for complete day with average usage and not more than 10 minutes of game play- User interface was better in previous models- There is no option to cast the screen to smart TV's like all older models of Lenovo. This is a big drawback."

0,"Hello friends,I am using this phone for last two days. My review is1) Company is claiming to have helio x23 but actually is helio x20 if u install CPU-z software u can check it.2) Camera has no issues, it is working fine.3) Mobile has some issues with heating as it has helio precossor.4) Battery drains fast as it works 10-12 hours on low to medium usage.I haven't installed any games yet so I can't give my comments on that."
1,Nice product and process by Amazon
0,Battery drainage Issues on first day.
0,"This phone has a major bug. If the phone is kept idle for 15 mins(with wifi and data off and no calls for 15 mins), the software of the phone automatically goes into sleep mode, and if someone is calling you after 15 mins, he or she will hear that the number is unreachable."

1,"Awesome phone...keep it up Lenovo. But i am having the worse delivery experience service from amazon. The phone is so cool.its processor so fast .Trust me guys this phone is better then lg,, motorolla, mi, of all lestest models"
1,"Cons: 1.Heating Issue - Phone easily gets at around 40 degrees while charging and also while playing heavy games or camera.2. Camera - After the software update you may experience depth mode little better, still the edges get blurred.3. Battery Backup - Its written 4000mah but equivalent to 3500mah.4. Slight Slutter, No Lag5. 4 Gb Ram Variant is preferable & for performance as well and also black variant looks cool and premium.6. You cannot put a tempered glass on its display as 2.5D curved edges will show up bubbles around edges.7. They did provide a turbo charger but it takes 2.2 hours for this phone to charge fully."

0,"Pretty disappointing product. Lenovo was able to generate some sort if hype successfully, touting K8 note as a music phone and dual camera phone (capable of taking bouquet snaps, like DSLRs) etc. Infact, features were lucrative. After 3 months usage, really unhappy about the product. In fact, within a couple of days of receipt I tried to return this piece, which Amazon didn't accept. So, buyers better be aware of the 10 days return acceptance claim being put forward by Amazon, its not a 'no question asked' return policy. I accept the phone was not faulty (technically), hence the customer support person couldn't help me out perhaps (even though he agreed to initiate the return procedure prima facie). All said and done, I am still a loyal customer of Amazon, only angry with Lenovo and on myself, why I jumped on to purchase immediately the phone got released! Shouldn't have done this mistake being a gadget-geek myself... My bad :(There's really no point in making an attempt to write a product review. Simply put, its a mediocre product. Apart from the dedicated nano sim slots + dedicated microsd memory card slot, nothing is actually likeable. Only this feature is worthy mentioning, as I hate the combined sim & memory tray slots where you need to choose only 2 out of the 3 (using Redmi note 4 as well, and this is something I hate about the otherwise brilliant phone). One more observation. K8 note was touted and hyped as a stock android phone. At least for me, the stock OS (nougat) didn't impress me. I am using 3 different custom UI layers ( MIUI for Xiaomi, EUI for my Le Eco Max 2, TouchWiz in Samsung Galaxy Note 3) and anyday would vote for them for providing with enhanced, intelligent usability, especially MIUI and TouchWiz. Have not used Oxygen-mod myself, though apparently it felt quite good. I didn't find this stock Android in K8 note really fast, devoid of any lag etc. From the 'Ease of usage' perspective, I was not at all impressed. Hence, even if the custom UIs have some lag/slowness and bloatwares, that's the tread off I am ready to embrace any day, just for the logic and intelligence they provide with."

0,"Positive-Descent look.On paper nice specifications.Cost almost ok but it should be 10k.Supporting both Sims.Separately memory card slot.Negative-A lots of points- -veHeats up very fast.Auto shutting down and restarting frequently in a day ie normally 5 to 8 times.Auto shut down and restart most negative issue.Battery drains spuriously.Both sim slots support volte but signal strength is very very poor.Android v7.1.1 useless because it is not stable till date.Totally wastage of money, rather buying k8 note go for redmi note 4 which is best mobile with lesser cost.This is huge question mark on Lenevo and Motorola both the brands are manufacturing together Lenevo based mobiles.I m regretting after buying k8 note.Pls don't buy or go for another lower or upper brands.Pls mind Amazon too, because it makes online shopping fake by selling such stupid mobiles.Now customers should wait for two sim slots and MMC cards both supporting mobiles."

0,This is my first and last Lenovo mobile. Worst ever quality control. Two major problems:1. Screen mirroring does not work and this is for all the users who bought this mobile. A simple basic feature which would want to connect to tv.I use an Amazon fire stick and it doesn't work with that too.2. Volte mode is not proper. Jio sim works but worst ever network strength.The most irritating part being that Lenovo is not providing any update for these issues.

1,CuxgF
0,"Worth for it's price range???ü§îGoogle chrome it's working properly, in some applications finger print is not working properly, had just used for 2 days. It's hard to focus in depth mode, shutter nice can't be made silent. The sensor of camera is not good but below average, my previous HTC 8 MP camera had good details and clarity. Camera works poor in the low light condition. It's an all rounder average phone as Lenovo k8 note doesn't have any speciality, it is average on everything right from the processor, camera clarity, battery life, gaming, ...etc.Being an Android battery is not so good, but power bank is it's solution. Mutli tasking , many more good features, fast Prosser, touch pad is also fast, finger sensor is also fast, speaker is very nice and loud. It has cool features like for typing, fingerprint sensor, dedicated music key, camera key, selfie flash light, rear camera You have dual LED Flashlight,Using since last 7 days , will update review after some weeks.Lenovo k8 note my review (4GB ram 64GB ROM)I am using this phone from last one week on the basis of my experience I would share you pros and cons of the Lenovo k8 note. An average user of phone like watching videos playing games.Pros:- good display clarity- typing features- dedicated music key- dedicated camera key- fingerprint sensor which is quite fast- 13 + 5 MP dual camera with dual LED flash light- 13mp selfie camera with LED Flashlight- 4 GB RAM 64 GB ROM- dedicated memory slot- 4000 Mah li-polymer batteryüîã- good office phone- guest mode feature- Many other features you can unlock- good sound quality in speakers and decently loud- you can record the calls with very good clarity of both the sides- mobiles turns off when overcharged (had just read on the Internet not sure about it)- good for gaming- camera capturing in savings speed is decently good- doesn't lags in office applications-has good internet speed as compared to my previous mobile- speech to text feature is also quite good, recognizes almost all words even the local language i.e hindi- have emojis and gif keypad- average graphics for the gaming part- has decent touch sensitivity and speed- live QR and barcode reader- Google map does works pretty well you get a notification of trafficCons:- processor is not battery efficient- mobiles get heated up while charging, gaming and movies- overall average phone- doesn't have any USP- Camera sensor is very poor due to which the clarity of the photos are affected also the low light performance the GIF file has also a very poor quality, my previous HTC had 8 MP camera whose clarity was much better than this.- Google Chrome doesn't works properly- compare to the size of the image from the camera the clarity is not that good- hard to focus especially in depth mode- doesn't has image stabilization- GIF images doesn't have good quality, however the gif quality is not so bad as it appears while shooting on the screen but yes it's quite dark compared to the video mode.- multiple clicks does make the phone lag a bit- can't read barcode and QR code on the image you saved- depth mode in the camera doesn't get a very sharp image you definitely have the edges a bit soft around you have to take couple of shots to have a very perfect photograph many times you miss the moment, especially when it comes to micro photography"

But same issue in the replacement phone(same model, lenovo K8 Note) as well. Finally getting its refund after many efforts and wasting lot of time.If somebody calls you, most of the time it will show your phone out of coverage, even when phone is in network. Verified this by call myself from my another phone. You will always get messages of many missed calls, but very few calls.Whereas, when I insert my sim in my old motorola phone, everyting works well at same location.If you are unable to make or recieve calls most of the time from a phone, then no use of talking about its other good features like camera, display, looks etc."

0,"Disappointed with the network reception of the mobile. Phone gets idle and calling party is not able to make call. Message comes as 'Number not reachable', although it shows full network in cell phone.This is the fundamental thing for any cell phone to get incoming and outgoing call which is not happening with Lenovo K8 note. Raised the request and tried reaching customer care but no response from Lenovo team.I will suggest NOT to purchase LENOVO K8 NOTE."
1,awesome mobile but for 4000 mah battery it should do better
0,"yesterday received phone in good condition, today morning charged 100 % but its continuously draining now its about only 40 %, it is same a my K3 note. so what is the benefit of K8 4000 battery. need replacement with good battery.Turbo charger is not work properly taking long hrs for charging....Amazone replaced new phone on 25/05/2018 , but the issue was not resolved ie. turbo charger not worked, yesterday (28/05/18) on screen data usage warning appeared, when i was seen i m socked, as data usage limit set from may 11-jun-10 and in two days only 699 mb i had used, wi-fi data usage limit set Apr-30-May-28 its means, this is used handset. so it is cheating with me , now i need refund , please do the needful."

1,Very easy to handle even while travelling. Battery life is excellent. Gets little warm when used for more than half an hour at a stretch. Tough yet trendy.
0,Phone is good but has little problem with network connection also getting heat
1,Good one
1,It is a good phone except slight heating issue and photo quality is not so good. Phone heated up lightly after 15 to 20 min of use.
0,I have purchased this phone 3 months back and was very excited when the phone arrived. Honestly speaking every thing in this phone is good except the battery life. The battery really sucks. It doesn't really make any difference weather the internet is on or off. The battery drains like hell even in the standby mode which is really disappointing. The battery drains very fast even when the battery saver mode is on. A 4000 mah battery should have lasted longer and Lenovo could have worked in a bit better way to increase the battery power as compared to Redmi Note 4 which comes with a 4100 mah battery and is simply brilliant in its segment with such a lower price as compared to this phone. Hope you understand this and do some thing better towards resolution.

Phone switches off after getting charged, takes forever to boot up, Magic button never worked for music but at least it's working for capturing screenshots now.Though from parent company of Motorola, this doesn't get OS upgrades (it does get updates for the same OS).I'm not sure if this is an Android feature or of this phone- there's no way to forget a WiFi network AND have the phone remember not to connect to it in the future. The phone reads an unsecured network at work and connects to it every day even though I keep selecting ""Forget network"".Won't ever buy a Lenovo again."

0,Bluetooth is not working properly!!!
0,Stock android software on this phone is really bad. Absolutely no functionality at all. Also no back-lit home buttons. What are you guys thinking. I had to return this phone due to bad software.. Hardware has no use if software is bad..Correct your software by adding appropriate user interface.. And back-lit buttons.
1,"Phone is working fine. Processor and battery performances are very good. Connectivity is also cool. Only concern is with over heating, set is getting hot after 30 mins of continuous use. The heating problem needs be addressed to make the set a perfect one."
0,This product is utter waste..touch is not satisfactory..many options are unavailable..it's not worthy for it's price
0,Just average productNothing specialNot happy with this phone
1,Nice
0,"Phones seems to be ok. But Battery is very poor. Drains on its own. MI is far better compared to Lenovo K8. Never buy this phone.It's a loss if you buy. I returned in few days and Amazon return policy is also not good. They will assign some person to check who will take his own time and Amazon will not refund, they will replace the phone with another phone with same troubles. Later I requested for refund. It's a huge process. Flipkart is very simple."

1,Amazing product...no heating issue...battery could have stayed a lil longer for the 4000mah description. Great features and looks good too. Headsets are not provided in the box.
1,"It's very nice K8(4GB, 64GB) mobile, all features are awesome. I have received it on 14.09.17 as promised. Only the issue of battery life is matter of concern. Today Updated by Lenovo regarding these issues, let's see. But overall good choice."
1,Good phone around 10k for all round performance
0,Wort product got a damaged one. Has some issue with network.. Amazon service was not good. Dnt buy this product.
1,*4.5 stars*I received this phone on 22/03/2018.I did a lot of research before buying this and the issue which most of the people were having were:OverheatingLow battery optimizationDepth mode etc...So first of all... I'm an average person with quite a bit of knowledge of smartphone specs...I found this smartphone to be great according to myself.Overheating was not an issue to me. Even though I'm bit of a gamer and I do play heavy games often. Surely the phone does heat a bit but not as much as I'd have to stop using it or playing games on itBattery is a great deal for me...I tend to spend most of time on my phone but then also I think battery is very powerful...and for surfing sites n apps the battery won't drop a single percent for about 20 mins....and the turbo charger is just awesome...it charges so quickly that You just can't argue...Lastly the cameraWell I'm someone who never owned a phone with dual camera before...so i liked it pretty much.its not a problem for me. So if you are someone who only had single camera phone till now then this K8 Note camera is great for You...but if you have owned such earlier then i don't know what to compare it with.I hope this helps!
1,Good phone

1,Excellent product manufactured by Lenovo it's owesome .
0,Its one speaker is not working
0,First of all I wd say the phn is overvalued considering its price to features parameter....sound...display.... touch effects all needs much improvements...then there is hanging issues.... eg..Dolby feature gets hanged often...camera rear doesn't give u expected pic clarity though depth effect is present in its dual rear interface....all in all disappointed ...although I was expecting reasonable better features for a 12 - 13 k...device taking Lenovo into consideration...

1,Good but note best
1,Lenovo k8 note is a good device but it's not a perfect one.The first problem which I faced is it's overheating and it's ram management.Hardly 2gb is available for our usage.But the main attraction of this phone is it's camera.
1,"It's a great phone, the music is awesome in headphones for this price. It's a very premium phone with looks, feel and usage , it's fluid to use. The phone gets little hot but not that much it's during charging and heavy usage. I will definitely recommend this phone who looks a great phone for low cost or any one who looks a great phone."
